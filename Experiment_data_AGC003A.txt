Source Code Description:
Snuke exists in a two-dimensional plane that is limitless. He'll be gone for N days. 
He is at home at the start of Day 1. A string S of length N describes his strategy. 
He will go a positive distance in the following direction on Day i(1iN):
If the i-th letter of S is N, it is north; if the i-th letter of S is W, it is west.
If the i-th letter of S is S, go south; if the i-th letter of S is E, go east.
He hasn't determined how far he'll travel each day. 
Determine whether each day's travel distance may be adjusted such that he arrives home at the end of Day N.

Description for code block 1 (Line 5 to 9) : main function, declare string S, input S, declare two int variables recording north and west steps, iterate S from index 0 to the legnth of S
Description for code block 2 (Line 20 to 20) : output yes if north and west step are 0, output no if north or west step is not 0
Description for code block 3 (Line 10 to 17) : if s[i] equals N, north step plus 1, if s[i] equals S, north step minus 1, if s[i] equals E, west step plus 1, else, west step minus 1
Description for code block 4 (Line 1 to 4) : include stdc++ headerfile, specify namespace
Description for code block 5 (Line 18 to 19) : 
Description for code block 6 (Line 21 to 22) : 

Fixed Line: Line 14
