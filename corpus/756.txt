I have been asked to alter the add function so that it adds objects Term in order from smallest to largest. (Term is a simple class taking the form Term(int power))  I cannot figure out how to create a loop in addTerm() in order to keep searching the next element to see if it is larger than the current power in Term. Can anyone help?  already has a loop in it that does exactly what you're asking for. I think your problem resides within the iterator implementation.  You might want to add an explanation of the intended operation of your code. Also: should raise when past the end. Your implementation gets a generic null pointer.  1 Answer 1  You cannot easily use your iterator as it goes through values instead of nodes:  If you want to use iterator, than you should define the 'Node' iterator (and use it in your addTerm method), and re-use it to define the 'Term' iteraotr:  By clicking “Accept all cookies”, you agree Stack Exchange can store cookies on your device and disclose information in accordance with our Cookie Policy.
