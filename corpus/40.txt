 Amazon Interview Experience for SDE-1  Hi All, Initially, I have found the Amazon SDE job requirement on Linked In then I applied on the Amazon job portal for the same. I got an email for round one after two weeks.  Round 1: It was conducted online and needs to implement the coding on the HackerRank platform. There are 3 sections of the assessment.  Coding challenge (2 scenarios) and Coding approach (elaborate why you code the way you do) – 105 minutes  Given a matrix with values 0 (trenches), 1 (flat), and 9 (obstacle) you have to find the minimum distance to reach 9 (obstacle). If not possible then return -1. The demolition robot must start at the top left corner of the matrix, which is always flat and can move on the block up, down, right, left. The demolition robot cannot enter 0 trenches and cannot leave the matrix.  All test cases passed for both so that I expected for the second round. After 15-20 days I got a mail from HR for an Amazon Chime Interview. There will be 2 rounds on that day only.  Here I took more time to solve this problem and approached the brute force approach. The interviewer didn’t ask for an efficient approach since I have crossed the time limit.  Round 3:  In this round questions asked all about arrays and string  Here The Interviewer expects an efficient solution for all the questions but I gave the efficient solution for question 1 alone.  Next week I got a call from HR, badly I am not shortlisted for the upcoming rounds anyway I got an experience. I could suggest everyone should try to work on problems for efficient approach.  Writing code in comment?
