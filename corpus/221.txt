Have you checked if you are running out of memory? Since is storing the by value I would expect memory usage to explode pretty fast as you increase the number of vertexes and connections between them.  By clicking “Accept all cookies”, you agree Stack Exchange can store cookies on your device and disclose information in accordance with our Cookie Policy.
