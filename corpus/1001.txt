How to do this? What condition should be put in If? I know is pretty simple, but I can't do this.  I don't really understand, where is the FileInformation class in TreeNode<FileInformation> tree?? could you show the whole code?  You need to print out "|" whenever on the corresponding level you are not processing the last entry, but one of the entries before the last. You need to know this for every level separately, so you could add a bit mask or a string (say) as an extra argument to 'getInto'.  Nice one, would have been more helpfull if you would have named the variables and methods in english :)  I was testing the solution with the most upticks written by @tan70 however it caused a null pointer exception on printing my home directory. I did some investigation and found that listFiles() can return null.  public File[] listFiles()  Returns an array of abstract pathnames denoting the files in the directory denoted by this abstract pathname.  If this abstract pathname does not denote a directory, then this method returns null. Otherwise an array of File objects is returned, one for each file or directory in the directory  By clicking “Accept all cookies”, you agree Stack Exchange can store cookies on your device and disclose information in accordance with our Cookie Policy.
