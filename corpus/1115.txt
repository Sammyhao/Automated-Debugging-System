I am using this code to know whether a cycle is there or not in adjacency matrix. for example Let A be the adjacency matrix for the graph G = (V,E). A(i,j) = 1 if the nodes i and j are connected with an edge, A(i,j) = 0 otherwise.  My objective is the one of understanding whether G is cyclic or not. A cycle is defined in the following way:  Well, you didn't post a complete code example so it is difficult to help you. One question could be: How do you ensure that both and is less than ?  V is the no. of node . it doesn't have to do anything with i[t] j[t]. i am posting my whole code.@PaulFloyd  By clicking “Accept all cookies”, you agree Stack Exchange can store cookies on your device and disclose information in accordance with our Cookie Policy.
