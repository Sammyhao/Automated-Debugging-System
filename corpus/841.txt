Then, do I have to change the five lines in for loop if I change Stack to Queue?  1 Answer 1  The old class is a , which is why you could call .  Now it seems that you want to use the API, but it doesn't has a , or any other kind of iterator that allows you to walk backwards.  So you have two choices:  Change your variable to be type , since it is both a and a at the same time, which means you get both APIs.  is the only built-in class implementing both.  Since your logic only requires you to look/remove backwards, you can change your logic to iterate backwards, instead of your current logic of iterating forward, then stepping backwards to remove previous element.  The API is an extension of the API, for using a "double ended queue". A double-ended queue can be iterated backwards using the method.  The advantage of is that there are 4 built-in implementations, giving you more choices: , , , .  If you choose option 2, your code would be something like this:  By clicking “Accept all cookies”, you agree Stack Exchange can store cookies on your device and disclose information in accordance with our Cookie Policy.
