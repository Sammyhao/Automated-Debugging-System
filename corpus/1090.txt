 Right view of Binary Tree using Queue  Given a Binary Tree, print Right view of it. Right view of a Binary Tree is set of nodes visible when tree is visited from Right side. Examples:  We have already discussed recursive solution for right view. In this post, level order traversal based solution is discussed. If we observe carefully, we will see that our main task is to print the right most node of every level. So, we will do a level order traversal on the tree and print the rightmost node at every level. Below is the implementation of above approach:  C++  Java  Python3  C#  Javascript  Output:  Time Complexity: O( n ), where n is the number of nodes in the binary tree.  Auxiliary Space: O( n ) for Queue Data Structure  ?list=PLqM7alHXFySHCXD7r1J0ky9Zg_GBB1dbk  This article is contributed by Bibhas Abhishek.
