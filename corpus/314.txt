The following obviously doesn't work :  because even if a node with those coordinates is in the queue, we're testing against a different XYNode object so it will always return false.  3 Answers 3  The simplest way is to override so that one knows whether it's equal to another . You should override at the same time, and possibly also implement to allow a strongly-typed equality comparison.  Alternatively, you could write an implementation to compare any two nodes and return whether or not they're the same - and then pass that into the call to the appropriate overload of the extension method defined in (assuming you're using .NET 3.5).  Further things to consider:  Could you use private fields instead of protected ones?  Could your class be sealed?  Could your class be immutable?  Should your class perhaps be a struct instead?

There are a lot of additional factors to consider, which Jon has already mentioned.  One handy thing about making a class sealed is that you can just use as/is instead of calling - you don't need to worry about being given a subclass instance.  By clicking “Accept all cookies”, you agree Stack Exchange can store cookies on your device and disclose information in accordance with our Cookie Policy.
