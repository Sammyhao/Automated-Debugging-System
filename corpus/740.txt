 your communities  Find centralized, trusted content and collaborate around the technologies you use most.  Connect and share knowledge within a single location that is structured and easy to search.  I have implemented Breadth First Search. The adjacency matrix(adj[][]) represents the relationship among different nodes and the nodes are stored in nodes[].  However, I do not get the required traversal. Please help me out. Below is my code. There are no syntax errors. It is probably a logical error that I am not able to find out by debugging.  Why insert and then have to look it up again, instead of just inserting ? Also - why are you inserting to only from index 1?  Ok, what is the content of ? is it unique? because all your comparisons would only work then. Why not keep the indices in ?  Aside from design issues as I mentioned (and also the goto, brrr..), i'm out of ideas. I also don't write what's wrong with the result. I suggest you check with a debugger.  By clicking “Accept all cookies”, you agree Stack Exchange can store cookies on your device and disclose information in accordance with our Cookie Policy.
