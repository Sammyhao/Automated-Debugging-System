 Algorithms | Graph Shortest Paths | Question 2  Last Updated : 28 Jun, 2021  To implement Dijkstraâ€™s shortest path algorithm on unweighted graphs so that it runs in linear time, the data structure to be used is: (A) Queue (B) Stack (C) Heap (D) B-Tree  Answer: (A) Explanation: The shortest path in an un-weighted graph means the smallest number of edges that must be traversed in order to reach the destination in the graph. This is the same problem as solving the weighted version where all the weights happen to be 1. If we use Queue (FIFO) instead of Priority Queue (Min Heap), we get the shortest path in linear time O(|V| + |E|). Basically we do BFS traversal of the graph to get the shortest paths.
