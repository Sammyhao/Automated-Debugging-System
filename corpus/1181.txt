But on the heap sort part, there was something wrong with my code. My input array is  {10,16,4,10,14,7,9,3,2,8,1}  and the first element just represents the number of elements that I would like to sort. In other words, the elements needed to be sorted start from index 1.  My output of build max-heap is : 16 14 10 8 7 9 3 2 4 1  And my output of heap sort is : 1 3 2 4 7 8 9 10 14 16  It seemed my build-max-heap part worked well but I couldn't find bugs in heap-sort part, either.  By the way, I am wondering if you are considering the 10 to be part of heap or not?  7,71333 gold badges2323 silver badges4444 bronze badges  2  It seemed that my maxHeapify part broke down, either. When my input{10,4,1,3,2,16,9,10,14,8,7}. The the build max output is {16 14 10 8 1 9 3 2 4 7}, obviously it couldn't be right output of the maxHeapify part.  I was wondering whether the linked list or ArrayList would be better for implementing such algorithm.  By clicking “Accept all cookies”, you agree Stack Exchange can store cookies on your device and disclose information in accordance with our Cookie Policy.
