 Create a Sorted Array Using Binary Search  Given an array, the task is to create a new sorted array in ascending order from the elements of the given array. Examples:  The above problem can be solved efficiently using Binary Search. We create a new array and insert the first element if itâ€™s empty. Now for every new element, we find the correct position for the element in the new array using binary search and then insert that element at the corresponding index in the new array. Below is the implementation of the above approach:  C++  Java  Python3  C#  Javascript  Output:  Time Complexity: O(N*N). Although binary search is being used, the list insert calls run in O(N) time on average Auxiliary Space: O(N)  Writing code in comment?
