Essentially in a merge sort you recursively split the list in half until you have single elements and than build it back up in the correct order. merge sort on has a complexity of and is an extremely stable sorting method.  Here are some good in depth explanations and visuals for merge sorting:  Above is a more readable recursive implementation of Quick Sort Algorithm. Above piece of code is from book Functional programing in python by O'REILLY. Above function will produce.  Welcome to StackOverflow.
