I have an adjacency matrix representing an MST. A much shorter version can be found below.  At first I tried using simple DFS but as expected it failed when the components were no longer connected. The main problem is that this is only one of many adjacency matrices I need to process. I read about placing virtual root node per tree in the forest but this won't work because the adjacency matrix represents superpixels in an image and changes according to what is depicted. Thus I need help finding (if it exists) an algorithm able to detect the discontinuities and perform DFS per tree.  1 Answer 1  Pretty simple: you've got a list of nodes. Just remove all nodes that were traversed by a single DFS-run from that list and start over with an arbitrary node of the list. Repeat this until the list is empty and you've traversed all trees.  By clicking “Accept all cookies”, you agree Stack Exchange can store cookies on your device and disclose information in accordance with our Cookie Policy.
