I have a class for my HashEntry (acts as a private inner class) and a class for the HashTable itself. I am using numpy object arrays for this.  When I attempt to implement my "remove" method, I need to be able to find the hashEntry in the hashArray by its key. This means I have to iterate through the hashEntry ojects in the hashArray, and access each 'key' attribute for 'entry'. When I run the code, I get the error:  AttributeError: 'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'key'  How can I iterate through a numpy object array, and access each of their attributes? Or did I set something up wrong? My code is as follows:  For context, 'findNextPrime' is just class function to get the next prime number after the one given. (not relevant)  2 Answers 2  I don't think using an object array instead of a list has any advantage. Except for a few indexing tasks, using an object array is slower. I (and others) have discussed this lots of times on SO (though I'm not sure there's an easy way to find such answers).  192k1313 gold badges191191 silver badges301301 bronze badges  1  I would use a list however I need to implement functionality where a maximum capacity for the array can be declared. For example, in this instance, the table should have a capacity of 151 (next prime after 150)  EDIT: I've discovered the issue. My object array wasn't full, and thus had null elements. This means my iterator works, but since it passes through the null elements, it gives the error.  By clicking “Accept all cookies”, you agree Stack Exchange can store cookies on your device and disclose information in accordance with our Cookie Policy.
