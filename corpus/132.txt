I say no because of the nature of recursive re-tracing back unless I implemented incorrectly? I have been searching the internet and all i can find is an iterative version. Here is my method:  @KamelBOUYACOUB since you touch any node once at most, I'd say that yes - it is as efficient as it gets. Pay attention that basically this is a DFS scanning of the tree starting from the root node and going down.  That will return a reference to the node, which is a little more useful IRL. You can change it to return a boolean though.  By clicking “Accept all cookies”, you agree Stack Exchange can store cookies on your device and disclose information in accordance with our Cookie Policy.
