I am implementing the program in C++. I am clueless how to go about the same.  EDIT: I know the pseudo code of bfs. What i am searching for is how to convert the above pseudo code of dfs to bfs.  Read Cormen Leiserson Rivest - Introduction to algorithm to first understand what's the difference between DFS and BFS...  I don't understand your EDIT. If you know the pseudo code for BFS why are you asking how to convert the DFS to BFS?  There is a discrepancy in your code as to when a vertex is marked. Usually you mark a vertex before inserting it into the stack, but the neighbours of the initial vertex v are put into the stack without being marked visited. So they most likely will be visited twice. I guess you should put v itself into the stack. The problem is the same after you convert things to BFS.  By clicking “Accept all cookies”, you agree Stack Exchange can store cookies on your device and disclose information in accordance with our Cookie Policy.
