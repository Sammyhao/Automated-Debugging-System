We are supposed to search for a number in the trees and print the tree and line number found. Because of this, we are supposed to use a Breadth-First Search function. I am getting a segmentation fault in my dequeue function and I am unsure why.  These are my structures:  This is my BFS function:  This is my enqueue:  This is my dequeue:  What am I doing wrong? The enqueue is working correctly, however my dequeue is not storing correctly.  EDIT: Apparently I need to:  "This function implements a variant of a level by level search or formally called as the BREADTH FIRST SEARCH. -> This function searches for a given value in the binary trees and it does that by searching for level 1 in each binary trees, then moving on to level 2 if it fails to find it that value in level 1 and so on. -> Basically, you have to search for a given value in all the binary trees, one level at a time, in the linked list simultaneously."  So I'm not sure if I need to search the whole tree, then move on, or look at each tree, line by line.  1 Answer 1  From the superficial look I had into the code, it looks generally ok (though I would have implemented some parts differently), but the last lines in are certainly wrong:  Accessing in the last line is catastrophic: holds an address that has already been freed ( and refer to the same memory location). I think you wanted to return instead:  You might as well throw away, as it seems useless, and turn that into:  By clicking “Accept all cookies”, you agree Stack Exchange can store cookies on your device and disclose information in accordance with our Cookie Policy.
