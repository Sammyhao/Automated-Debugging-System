However the graph shows there are other commits on the same branch as well.  Note: This graph is of our 'master' branch (left-most line is master).

The commits shown are the commits contained in that branch.  Remember: In git a "branch" is not much more than a label for some commit.  No, actually there is no "real" branch in git.
