From your terse problem description, it sounded like you were getting a compiler error. But from your later comments, it sounds like you are getting a fairly specific run-time diagnostic error which would have been very helpful for everybody to know.  2 Answers 2  I don't know what a is, but assigning another to inside the for loop, can't be a good thing:  You should at least reassign the iterator:  But i believe that code is far from correct. You are basically destroying the structure that you're iterating while iterating it.  EDIT: Well we do know what a MapType is now. All of the above is still correct. You can't just re-assign your maps while iterating them.  assgnt is name of my class in which "typedef std::multimap<int, int> MapType;" is declared  You are modifying a map while you are iterating on it. This is not supported by containers and as such is a bug in your program. Currently you are completely overwriting the object but more in details even adding elements is not supported.  You are getting this error probably because you are in debug mode and I would not be surprise if that would just crash in production.  To achieve the same effect you could use a temporary map:  By clicking “Accept all cookies”, you agree Stack Exchange can store cookies on your device and disclose information in accordance with our Cookie Policy.
