The question is about sorting royal names with roman numerals. Given was a list of strings that we had to sort. The input obeyed the following constraints:  1) length of the list  2)Each name started with a capital letter followed by a space followed by a roman numeral between 1 and 50 inclusive.  3) Each number is a Roman numeral with capital letters , , , .  The code is as follows:  I have debugged this code with multiple inputs and can't figure out what the problem is. Can anyone please point out any mistake that I am overlooking?  Is your program expected to reject invalid input? That is, what happens if somebody gives you a name, or ?  4 Answers 4  I suspect you are meant to sort these in numerical order.  If so, the problem is that you are converting to a string before sorting. In Python string comparison is lexicographic (i.e. normal alphabetic order) which means "9" > "50", while as integers, 9<50.  To fix, you could use a two stage comparison that first compares the name of the king as a string, then the number as an integer.  def decode(s): if s == "I": return 1 elif s == "V": return 5 elif s == "X": return 10 elif s == "L": return 50  def romanToInt(num): res = 0  def getSortedList(names):  arr = ["Richard LXV","Henry VI","Edward IX","Richard XXV","Henry IX","Edward L"] print (getSortedList(arr))  By clicking “Accept all cookies”, you agree Stack Exchange can store cookies on your device and disclose information in accordance with our Cookie Policy.
