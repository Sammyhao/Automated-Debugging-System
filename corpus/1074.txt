For one of the coding problems, they have a basic program involving a queue and have a number of tests that your algorithm should pass. One of the methods is a method to print all elements in the queue without changing the content of the queue. I cannot figure out how print them all out without removing the contents. Below is the code I have so far (which doesn't work, stackOverflowError result) and the test the algorithm should pass.  10933 gold badges44 silver badges1212 bronze badges  4  Can't you make an immutable view? This is Java so I'd be looking at the standard library.  @Dabo I know we can't change the parameters of the function. It has to be a void function.  @wheaties I'll look into trying an immutable view to see if it will solve my problem.  By clicking “Accept all cookies”, you agree Stack Exchange can store cookies on your device and disclose information in accordance with our Cookie Policy.
