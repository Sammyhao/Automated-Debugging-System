Virtual cluster has been working just fine on either machines. But when I try to change it to a real cluster, the job starts and gets stuck in the state in the Job Tracker. It does not start map/reduce at all (doesn't even show map 0% reduce 0%, just says the application ID and is then blank).  I have tried modifying the configuration files to use correct amount of memory. But it always results in the same thing. Here are my config files, along with a DEBUG log when trying to run wordcount.  I have removed some of the DEBUG lines since they were a lot of duplicated of "cloud1 sending X" / "cloud1 receiving X" otherwise the log was too long to post.  By clicking “Accept all cookies”, you agree Stack Exchange can store cookies on your device and disclose information in accordance with our Cookie Policy.
