After some debugging I found out that all nodes get visited but my queue never gets empty. Why is that?  1 Answer 1  2,11622 gold badges1818 silver badges3333 bronze badges  2  I had been trying to find out where the problem was for 2 hours :D. thank you! you made my day.  @FoxyZ You can consider adding a condition before exiting the loop, if all your nodes have been visited or not, just in case your graph is not connected!!  By clicking “Accept all cookies”, you agree Stack Exchange can store cookies on your device and disclose information in accordance with our Cookie Policy.
