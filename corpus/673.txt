If it is then is your graph a directed graph ? as 5 is connected to 6 but 6 is not connected to 5, same is true for 7->8 and 9->10  Yes, the array is indeed adjacency matrix and its uni-directional graph. I added a image of the graph with question.  FWIW there’s no need to pass the adjacency matrix around. The value never changes  1 Answer 1  Your code is perfectly correct, just call is incorrect. You're calling the dfs on the 1st node, but root is at 0th node.  So if you just replace  with  it would print the correct order of indices, which means every element would be one less than your required result as Java array index starts at 0.  Also there's no need to initialize a primitive array as Java primitive arrays are already initialized and default value of boolean is false.  By clicking “Accept all cookies”, you agree Stack Exchange can store cookies on your device and disclose information in accordance with our Cookie Policy.
