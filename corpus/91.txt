Every element of the formed matrix is an object of , to be able to store information , position in (respecively row, column) and .  I am able to even find a character in the matrix and return it's location, but I do not know how to do search from character to character by breadth first search. My last try is in , but I saw that use of queue is probably what I shoud do instead of this.  How can I go from char A to char B in a matrix of characters ?  1 Answer 1  You are correct, you need a queue for Breadth-First search, and a stack for Depth-First search, which are the key differences between the two.  First, I would personally add a function to your matrix named get neighbors to acquire the neighbors for a cell, then code BFS like this.  Using that you can simply write a BFS function.  You may need to tweak it a little to fit with your program, and note that this solution does not maintain a list of visited nodes, so you may skip over some that have already been evaluated.  By clicking “Accept all cookies”, you agree Stack Exchange can store cookies on your device and disclose information in accordance with our Cookie Policy.
