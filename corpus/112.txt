I'm trying to add a mathematical expression to a binary tree but I can't understand the algorithm. Here it is:  and the code that I made so far:  I know it's a big mess but I can't realize how to implement it. Can somebody explain the algorithm to me or give me a source with C++ code or better explained algorithm?  P.S. Here is the new code that I wrote but it works only for expressions like: (5+2)  what is problem with this code, what exactly you didn't understand -- I didn't get you.  It's obvious that the code is not following the algorithm. I can't understand how the algorithm is working. For example if the token is '(' I go to the left child of the current node. Then lets say that the next token in the expression is a number. I add this number to the current node and I must go back. But how can I go back to the parent? I will go back to line 13 and the program will end. What should be the structure that I must use?  By clicking “Accept all cookies”, you agree Stack Exchange can store cookies on your device and disclose information in accordance with our Cookie Policy.
