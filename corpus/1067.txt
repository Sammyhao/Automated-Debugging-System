That is undefined behavior. Even if was somehow initialized to null in an unreliable way, and that wouldn't crash somehow, you'd also fail in your destructor's , since assumes its original argument is not null.  I assume you meant to  If is not meant to hold a value, then you're going to have to refactor your code to first initialize to null - there's no working around that - and handle the case where is null explicitely in all your code.
