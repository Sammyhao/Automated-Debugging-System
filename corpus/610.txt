I don't want to pass only one instance of the array but the entire thing.  What should I do to be able to pass an array data structure as a parameter between two programs?  2 Answers 2  If you really have the PGM1 prototype defined in PGM1 and another definition of the PGM1 prototype in PGM2, then I recommend you move the prototype with the EXTPGM keyword into a copy file, and copy it into both PGM1 and PGM2. Having two separate prototypes defeats the ability of the compiler to ensure that parameters are passed correctly. It's too easy to change the prototype in the program itself and forget to change all the prototypes in the callers.  By clicking “Accept all cookies”, you agree Stack Exchange can store cookies on your device and disclose information in accordance with our Cookie Policy.
