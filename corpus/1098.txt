These column lengths might change from one report to another.  If you are going to use autofilter, that isn't the same as sorting. You only need to write to reset any sorting. Based on your current code, just remove from everywhere and fix a range to sort and you will be able to get it to run.  3 Answers 3  The above code worked.Thank you all for your replies guys. i really appreciate all your help.  Obviously this is rough, you will need to make it your own, but it will allow you to sort the E column which is what your initial code looks like it was trying to do.  The Range.Sort method can be used for a quick one column sort and discards much of the verbose code produced when recording a worksheet sort operation. Without an active AutoFilter, this is the better way to go.  I prefer to work with the LBound and UBound functions to determine the scope of an array.  By clicking “Accept all cookies”, you agree Stack Exchange can store cookies on your device and disclose information in accordance with our Cookie Policy.
