I have implemented a simple technique of recursion to add nodes in the tree. But when I input the values and ran the code I got segmentation fault:  1 Answer 1  You are getting a segmentation fault because you never set the head, there for when you get to the line  Your root value will be NULL, (since it was set to by head, which is NULL).  A "root" (or "head") node is typically a special case scenario, you should check to see if that node has been constructed at the top of , and if not, then you assign the node node to it.  Also, your code has in error in it as does not return a value.  By clicking “Accept all cookies”, you agree Stack Exchange can store cookies on your device and disclose information in accordance with our Cookie Policy.
