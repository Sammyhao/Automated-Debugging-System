 Average of pairwise difference of all pairs formed from given N integers  Last Updated : 13 Dec, 2021  Given an array arr[] containing N integers, the task is to calculate the average of the difference between both elements in pairs formed from given N integers.  Examples:  Input: arr[] = {-1, 3, -5, 4} Output: 5.166667 Explanation: There are 6 possible pair of points in the given array with the pairwise difference as: diff(-1, 3) = 4, diff(-1, -5) = 4, diff(-1, 4) = 5, diff(3, -5) = 8, diff(3, 4) = 1, diff(-5, 4) = 9. Therefore, average pairwise difference is (4 + 4 + 5 + 8 + 1 + 9)/6 = 31/6 = 5.166667.  Input: arr[] = { -1, 2, -3, 7, -6 } Output: 6.2  Approach: This problem can be solved by using the Greedy Approach and prefix sum method. If the points in the array arr[] are in sorted order, then the sum of distances of ith point to all the greater points can be calculated as: (arr[i+1] – arr[i]) + (arr[i+2] – arr[i]) … + (arr[N-1] – arr[i]) => (arr[i+1] + arr[i+2]… + arr[N-1]) – arr[i] * (N – 1 – i). Using this observation, the given problem can be solved using the following steps:  Iterate through every index i and add (pre[N – 1] – pre[i]) – arr[i] * (N – 1 – i) into a variable ans.  The required answer is ans / count of pairs => ans / (N*(N-1)/2).  Below is the implementation of the above approach:  Writing code in comment?
