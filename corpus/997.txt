 Print all leaf nodes of an n-ary tree using DFS  Given an array edge[][2] where (edge[i][0], edge[i][1]) defines an edge in the n-ary tree, the task is to print all the leaf nodes of the given tree using.  Approach: DFS can be used to traverse the complete tree. We will keep track of parent while traversing to avoid the visited node array. Initially for every node we can set a flag and if the node have at least one child (i.e. non-leaf node) then we will reset the flag. The nodes with no children are the leaf nodes.  Below is the implementation of the above approach:  C++  Java  Python3  C#  Javascript  Output:  Time Complexity: O(N), where N is the number of nodes in the graph. Auxiliary Space: O(N)  Writing code in comment?
