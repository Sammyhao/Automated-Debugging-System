Here is my implementation so far:  To test that it works, I've taken an example from Figure 22.9 of the book:  After renaming the nodes a to h to , respectively, I ran the following test:  This test passes, confirming the gray-shaded SCCs in the figure.  For the 'real' exercise, however, I need to use an input file, SCC.txt, which contains 875,714 lines representing edges (as a head-tail pair of integers), and output the size of the five largest SCCs. To this end I tried the following test:  However, I run into a :  I've read about increasing sys.setrecursionlimit, but this doesn't seem to be a recommended practice. Other than than I'm not sure how I could improve the code as it fairly literally implements the pseudocode given in the book. Any ideas on how I can overcome this error?  2 Answers 2  I managed to solve the problem using the library with an increased and recursion limit. Here is the code of the solution:  The DFS has to be logically DFS, but programmatically you can try a work around.  writing the DFS in such a way that you can retry it from one of the top functions, if it reaches a near the recursion limit.  Try to use multiprocessing.  PS: Is it possible that an infinite recursion is occurring for the larger dataset? logical error which comes forth when using a larger dataset. If you have datasets of incremental sizes, you could also identify the limit of the algorithm's implementation in python.  By clicking “Accept all cookies”, you agree Stack Exchange can store cookies on your device and disclose information in accordance with our Cookie Policy.
