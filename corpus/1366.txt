In this problem, we work with Latin squares and matrix traces. The trace of a square matrix is the sum of the values on the main diagonal (which runs from the upper left to the lower right). An N-by-N square matrix is a Latin square if each cell contains one of N different values, and no value is repeated within a row or a column. In this problem, we will deal only with "natural Latin squares" in which the N values are the integers between 1 and N. Given a matrix that contains only integers between 1 and N, we want to compute its trace and check whether it is a natural Latin square. To give some additional information, instead of simply telling us whether the matrix is a natural Latin square or not, please compute the number of rows and the number of columns that contain repeated values.  4 Answers 4  I think you should mention your class name 'Solution'. for further information go through the link  The problem is that you are not importing Scanner class properly. Add this line at the top:  No, the import was in the code. I removed it in my edit as it goes without saying. Also, the first line "class Main {" could be removed because it's understood  People rarely post imports. Usually, they post methods and other essential lines like stack traces  And the line import java.util.* was hidden by code ticks ```, it happens when text is typed after ticks in one line. Code should start in the next line after the ticks  here is the python implementation of the code, this is working for all the test cases feel free to ask if you encounter an issue  By clicking “Accept all cookies”, you agree Stack Exchange can store cookies on your device and disclose information in accordance with our Cookie Policy.
