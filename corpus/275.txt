I've got something like this:  This should create 4 level's of recursion tree, but creates just one level of tree. I think it's the problem with parent pointers but i can't realize what really is happening.  that code doesnt do anything. Please provide a minimal reproducible example ie include a to make it a working example  1 Answer 1  You may also keep track of the tree depth as a data member for each node. Unfortunately, as you failed to provide a Minimal Complete and Verifiable Example, I cannot test this here.  Note also that your code had no destructor for , leaking all memory allocated with a node. This problem disappears when avoiding those pointers is favour of objects. As s are allocated on the heap anyway, this is the logical and correct way of doing things in C++.  Note further that you may want to avoid keeping the children in a linked list (linked lists are to be avoided if efficiency is important). You may instead use an array or .
