 Find maximum and minimum element in binary tree without using recursion or stack or queue  Last Updated : 04 Aug, 2021  Given a binary tree. The task is to find out the maximum and minimum element in a binary tree without using recursion or stack or queue i.e, space complexity should be O(1).  Approach : 1. Initialize current as root 2. Take to variable max and min 3. While current is not NULL  If the current does not have left child  Update variable max and min with current’s data if required  Go to the right, i.e., current = current->right  Else  Make current as the right child of the rightmost node in current’s left subtree  Go to this left child, i.e., current = current->left  Below is the implementation of the above approach :  Writing code in comment?
