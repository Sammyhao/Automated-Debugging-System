I get the following error:  This may be due to a corruption of the heap, which indicates a bug in test1.exe or any of the DLLs it has loaded.  The program is used to identify the hand through the camera feed and detect the contours of the hand.  Code:  This is the function where the crash occurs:  The bold line(findContours) is where the program breaks.  This is where the function is called:  This function is called when the user presses the key 'c'. I googled for solutions but didn't find anything that helped. Someone please help me!  Where do you populate ? If is what brakes don't you think its code would be important?  Corruption happens before the memory manager notices it, and it could have happened a long time ago.  @NathanOliver findContours is where contours is populated. It's an inbuilt function in opencv..  By clicking “Accept all cookies”, you agree Stack Exchange can store cookies on your device and disclose information in accordance with our Cookie Policy.
