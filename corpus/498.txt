How could i use aksh with the iterator, or is there a mistake in the line(sh.*it->second)?  Not sure about this issue, but make sure to check out sometime soon. :-) Gets useful very often  doesn't declare a pointer to function. It declares a pointer to member function. Those are vastly different things.  2 Answers 2  But, before you add it, please read this page! If you don't read that page, and if you do continue to use pointer-to-member-function, I guarantee you will tear your hair out.  Regarding official doc it's neither (*it).second not it->second to access values of a std::map through iterator: cplusplus.com/reference/stl/map  Doesn't work! error: base operand of '->' has non-pointer type 'std::pair<const std::basic_string<char, void (AKSH::*)()>'  As I said above, use (*it).second since (*it) give you access to the element value (std::pair<...>) of the map  1) gives you a , not a , so won't compile under any circumstance. 2) and are identical, you may use them interchangably, and 3) isn't a function pointer, it is a member-function pointer, which requires a whole other syntax for the call.  Rob is right, and I repaired it. It's easier, when you give a compilable unit in a question, or at least compilable up to one problematic thing, that is the core of the question.  By clicking “Accept all cookies”, you agree Stack Exchange can store cookies on your device and disclose information in accordance with our Cookie Policy.
