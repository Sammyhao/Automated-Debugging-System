I tried to make it work for strings as well. I made a few changes like converting all integers to strings and I've also added functions like strcpy() and strcmp() to handle string operations. But the code doesn't seem to work. Can someone explain to me what went wrong?  Can you be more explicit about what goes wrong? Or give an example of the strings you used and what happened? Also, Why 10? Why not a new node?  @doctorlove The program compiles without any errors but if I give any input, for instance - "school", The program stops execution and returns nothing.  is a pointer that points to a char that's stored somewhere else. So only allocates memory for the string pointer, not the actual string. You need a separate malloc for the string. Also, don't hard-code sizes, use .  @Dukeling Thank you for pointing it out. Can you please provide me with the appropriate code to allocate memory for both the string and the struct.  @doctorlove I've added these lines to my code for memory allocation: I'm still facing the same problem.  Thanks for your help guys. I've managed to fix the issue by using a character array instead of a pointer to char in main(). Can anyone explain to me why this happened.  You still haven't said what went wrong, but the member gets copied straight into in your version with but you didn't alloc enough space for the string. The +10 in your malloc buys you a bit of space, but possibly not enough  By clicking “Accept all cookies”, you agree Stack Exchange can store cookies on your device and disclose information in accordance with our Cookie Policy.
