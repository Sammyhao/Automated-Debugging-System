I recently ran into a bug that I'd like to debug using chrome dev tools.  In my webpack config file, I added the following line to generate source maps.  After running the following files were generated in my folder.  So I know for sure these files were generated. When I open up resources.entry.js in the chrome debugger, I see the following.  However, I can't seem to actually find the source map so that I can place a break point. I can't find it in the tree.  and I can't seem to do a to search for it like Chrome suggests.  What exactly do I need to do to be able to debug using my source javascript files?  92811 gold badge1111 silver badges2424 bronze badges  8  Manually adding it was the step I was missing. I can now see it in the document tree and add break points. Thank you.  Found it, you have to specifically select the concatenated js file and right click in its editor view. If you select some other file and right click in the editor view, "Add source map" option will not appear. You may want to add that step between steps 2 and 3 :)  I have tried to add it, but it doesn't do anything, what should be the url? I have added the same that appears in the processed js file, but is not working  By clicking “Accept all cookies”, you agree Stack Exchange can store cookies on your device and disclose information in accordance with our Cookie Policy.
