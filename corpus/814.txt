I as said I am new to c++, I am just trying everything that read  @Moj is a doubly linked list structure. Each element has a pointer to the next and previous node. That is how you iterate over it.  @Moj: That's what does for you. I would remove the member from and I would use a (or probably a , unless you have a reason to choose )  2 Answers 2  If your goal is to have a single list of your node struct, there is no need to manage next pointers your self. Inserting would stay the same (minus the line)  To pop all element of the list you would do something like  how can I access to data of each element ? something like : nodeKeeper.front()->source; because right now it just prints the last element which "head"  @Moj Does my update help now? I read the data with then I pop it out with . Does that work for you?  By clicking “Accept all cookies”, you agree Stack Exchange can store cookies on your device and disclose information in accordance with our Cookie Policy.
