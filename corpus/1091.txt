The right subtree stores the second part and its weight is the sum of the left child's weight and the length of its contained string.  The picture below is one of the examples from wikipedia.  .  I'm having trouble seeing where the numbers in the picture above are coming from.  Each node has a weight value equal to the length of its string plus the sum of all leaf nodes' weight in its left subtree  C = 6 + 0 (E + C's empty string's length )?  B = 6 + 3 + 0 + 0 (E + F + C's empty string's length + B's empty String length )?  That can't be right, Why is A 22? (6+6+9 = 21? 6+6+3+9 = 24?)  I'm pretty sure I've missed something. Can someone help clear it up for me?  1 Answer 1  Each node has a weight value equal to the length of its string plus the sum of all leaf nodes' weight in its left subtree...  A has no right subtree so its value is the sum of the weights of all the leaf nodes (even if A had a right subtree its value would be the same): 6+3+2+4+1+6=22  By clicking “Accept all cookies”, you agree Stack Exchange can store cookies on your device and disclose information in accordance with our Cookie Policy.
