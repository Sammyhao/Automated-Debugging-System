I should create a class, Sort that displays four integer numbers in increasing order. I learned something from here. Unfortunately, this program doesn't run, when compiling there is no error. The error message looks like this:  stderr Exception in thread "main" java.util.NoSuchElementException  How do you call your program? And how do you input the numbers? I just copied your code into my IDE and it runs fine. Additionally, which is line 9?  Another confusing thing: Your class is not public (which it should) and is named , whereas the source code is placed in a file called ? Hmmm ... Name your file and make your class public.  Actually, I don't know exactly how it reads numbers inputted since it didn't run. What do you mean by which is line 9?  Did you run this code directly from your IDE (Eclipse, Netbeans etc.)? I could imagine you might get that error if your IDE does not allow you to provide input on stdin.  No, file is named Sort. I am using BlueJ (which was recommended by Udacity), and it doesn't even show any errors, just stuck. So, I tried run it on online compiling(ideone.com) and here if class is public there is such error: Main.java:2: error: class Sort is public, should be declared in a file named Sort.java public class Sort. However, the file is named Sort(at least it shows Sort in Total Commander)  1 Answer 1  NoSuchElementException will be thrown if input is exhausted, i.e. the nextInt() method has no int to return. To fix this you can check if the scanner has more ints with before you call nextInt(). This should get rid of the error, I believe however that this is due to the program not reading all input so maybe should rewrite the input part.  hmmm, so I should change like this: a = keyboard.hasNextInt(); b = keyboard.hasNextint(); c = keyboard.hasNextint(); d = keyboard.hasNextint();  No, you have to check before assiging to variable: int a = -1; if(scanner.hasNextint()) { // Data exists a = scanner.nextInt(); } else { // No int input given, do stuff; }  By clicking “Accept all cookies”, you agree Stack Exchange can store cookies on your device and disclose information in accordance with our Cookie Policy.
