 How to Map a Function Over NumPy Array?  Last Updated : 28 Nov, 2021  In this article, we are going to see how to map a function over a NumPy array in Python.  Method 1: numpy.vectorize() method  The numpy.vectorize() function maps functions on data structures that contain a sequence of objects like NumPy arrays. The nested sequence of objects or NumPy arrays as inputs and returns a single NumPy array or a tuple of NumPy arrays.  Python3  Output:  Explanation: The function is passed to the vectorized method and again the array is passed to it and the function will return the array on which the array is applied.  The lambda is an anonymous function, it takes any number of arguments but evaluates one expression.  Python3  Output:  Method 3: Using an array as the parameter of a function to map over a NumPy array  We can map a function over a NumPy array just by passing the array to the function.  Python3  Output:  Explanation: The array is passed to the applyall() method and it will map the function to the entire array and the resultant array is returned.  Writing code in comment?
