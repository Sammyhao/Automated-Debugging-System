 Writing code faster during Competitive Programming in C++  This article focuses on how to implement your solutions and implement them fast while doing competitive programming.  Snippets Snippet is a programming term for a small region of re-usable source Code. A lot of modern text editors like Sublime provide you a functionality to automatically write a predefined snippet by just writing a keyword. One can speed up their implementation by using Snippets. So if you need to do a BFS or DFS(or any other code), you just need to press ‘Keyword+Tab’ to get it’s code.  How to add a snippet Adding a snippet in Sublime Text is pretty straightforward. Just navigate to Tools>Developers>New Snippet.  Use this as your base template for a snippet and paste the code that you want to use in your Snippet by replacing the comment and trigger Keyword.  Macros They are a way to assign shorter notations to things that are usually longer to write. They can be easily written using #define.  Example 2: Before using Macros:  After using Macros:  Note: Write your macros at the beginning of your code(refer to the template given below).  Using a Template Using a template is one of the best idea to speed up your implementation. Keep your template ready that has your macros written in them already. This helps in reducing a lot of your time which otherwise would have gone in writing the whole code from scratch. I use the following template, you can use one that suits you.  Thank you for reading, please let me know if you have some possible improvement or addition.  Writing code in comment?
