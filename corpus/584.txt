I implemented it in two ways  The First One  The Second One  The First One passed all test cases successfully.  The Second one passed more than half of the test cases and the remaining part kept getting Runtime Error  I can't really figure out why this is happening.  PS: Most of the failed test cases contain over 10000 values.  Have you run the program yourself with the failing test case, and watched it fail? Seems like that should be the first thing you do. Then you can see where it fails, and what the specific runtime error is. If you don't have access to the failing test case, then create one yourself.  it seems that talking inputs with input() will cause a Run Time Error. Maybe I should start optimizing my code in the future with stdin instead.  By clicking “Accept all cookies”, you agree Stack Exchange can store cookies on your device and disclose information in accordance with our Cookie Policy.
