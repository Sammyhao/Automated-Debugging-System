Our previous assignment was to create a Graph template using an adjacency-matrix. This homework assignment was to modify the previous one using an adjacency-list instead. I have the previous matrix based code commented out for reference.  I'm getting a Null pointer in the connectNode method where I bring in the ArrayList. Again please keep in mind this is homework. Thank you in advance for all your help.  edit: How do you get line numbers to appear within stackoverflow?  1 Answer 1  Isn't that what I'm doing a few lines lower at: if (!adjList.containsKey(srcIndex)) ...  added: if(adjList == null) adjList = new HashMap<Integer, List<Integer>>(); above it, works now.
