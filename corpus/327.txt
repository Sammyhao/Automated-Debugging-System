The C++ code doesn't specify a size for the output message pointer so I assume I don't have to using ctypes.  I then try calling my code in Python using:  Unfortunately, a dialog box error is displayed upon execution, saying:  I understand that this implies some error with my pointers where sprintf is meant to write the output message too, but I can't see what exactly is wrong. Is there a way to fix this please? Or am I handling pointers incorrectly? Thanks!  Thanks for the suggestion but the error message using CDLL in place of WinDLL is the same.  1 Answer 1  buf1 and buf2 (in underlying C) are seen as arrays, so they are already addresses.  31.1k99 gold badges4141 silver badges6767 bronze badges  1  Thanks for this suggestion and the links. Unfortunately, even after removing , the error remains with the same error message. I tried replacing POINTER(c_char) with c_char_p too but it makes no change. Are there any other obvious error / ways to debug this?
