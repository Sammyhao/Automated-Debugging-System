However, my code is exceeding the time limit.  it runs fine on my compiler and gives the correct output, but it is exceeding the time limit on leetcode  1 Answer 1  I believe binarySearch can run into an endless loop. When end = start + 1 you will get mid = start so if nums[start] < target you end up making a recursive call with the same parameters as before.  Same thing happens in the iterative binary search. Solution for the recursive binary search is to do (or if you're paranoid about overflow) which will make the division round up.  By clicking “Accept all cookies”, you agree Stack Exchange can store cookies on your device and disclose information in accordance with our Cookie Policy.
