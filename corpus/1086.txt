In particular I'm looking to this function:  where the last symbol is the empty set. I understand I should return an "empty" iterator there but what should I do? Maybe return the end() iterator?  5,33611 gold badge2323 silver badges3838 bronze badges  1  Could I use 0 instead? There is a function afterwards that returns FoundOnList(key,table_row) != 0 to see if certain element exists on the table.  There is no empty iterator concept in c++. You should return end() iterator. Even standard STL algoirthims do the same.  By clicking “Accept all cookies”, you agree Stack Exchange can store cookies on your device and disclose information in accordance with our Cookie Policy.
