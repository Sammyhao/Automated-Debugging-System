I am only using VB6 because I have to use it for college and I am totally stuck.  I have a listbox in which I want to display a name of a radio and then when I click the name I want it to put data into some textboxes, it is simple I know but I don't even fully know the VB6 syntax so I am totally stuck I have asked my teacher but he is not really any help.  This is the line that is highlited when I click debug:  This is code for the enitre form, again it is very simple and I barely know what I am doing most of this project is a copy and paste job:  It says a lot about a community when you have to begin by apologizing for the tools you're using.  They're STILL teaching VB6??? Tell them to join everyone else in the 3rd millenium!  2,86944 gold badges3232 silver badges5353 bronze badges  1  Thanks for the help man but after pestering my teacher a little more it seems it was me being a total retard, all I had to do was declare an int in option explicit to replace the x in my list code and then the major culprit was (and I have no idea how I didn't figure it out as I had considered it to be the problem earlier) the line: radCatList.Clear  By clicking “Accept all cookies”, you agree Stack Exchange can store cookies on your device and disclose information in accordance with our Cookie Policy.
