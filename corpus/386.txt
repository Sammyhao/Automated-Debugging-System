Do not use this header. Use the needed C++ headers  Do not use this. Use qualified names  fo never and under no circumstances use plain C-Style arrays. In your case you need a vector of vector  Both of your vector/array dimensions are one to small.  You add edge numbers up to 5. But your array/vector has only 5 elements. In C++ array indices start counting with 0. So, a vector v with 5 elements has element v[0], v[1], v[2], v[3], v[4]. If you try to access the index 5, you will have an out of bounds error. The program will crash.  10.2k33 gold badges1414 silver badges3535 bronze badges  3  For the first two points, it really depends on your context. In a programming context, it doesn't apply, you can simply look at the world champions' solutions.  @armin Montigny , Thanks a lot for the lightening , clear and detailed response I was trying to debug the code since past two days.I will keep all the suggestion offered.Thanks a lot for the help!  @L.Meyer in contests people use that because it saves time. In real code you'll quickly regret after using them. \@Armin sometimes you'll need C-style arrays to avoid heap allocation, although that should be replaced by  By clicking “Accept all cookies”, you agree Stack Exchange can store cookies on your device and disclose information in accordance with our Cookie Policy.
