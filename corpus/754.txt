I am done with the GUI, but I am stuck with the algorithm.  So far I can count the available moves of each block, which supposed to be the children nodes of the root node. Each node (linkedlist) has the position of each block, and all the nodes are being stored in a Set.  What I need now is to mark each node as visited, so I don't get into an infinite loop.  I would appreciate any kind of help, and please correct me if I am mistaken with anything.  4 Answers 4  This is an example of a breadth first search in java if you give some code we can help adapt it to yours  @ Growler I could not comment on aaronman's link (not enough rep) but the visited field is a public field member in the Node class.  As for print Node, I assume aaronman is just passing the node object to the print method and it is just displaying whatever data the Node class may hold  By clicking “Accept all cookies”, you agree Stack Exchange can store cookies on your device and disclose information in accordance with our Cookie Policy.
