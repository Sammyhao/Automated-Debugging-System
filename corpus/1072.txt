 Recursive Insertion Sort  Insertion sort is a simple sorting algorithm that works the way we sort playing cards in our hands. Below is an iterative algorithm for insertion sort Algorithm  Example:  Refer Insertion Sort for more details. How to implement it recursively? Recursive Insertion Sort has no performance/implementation advantages, but can be a good question to check oneâ€™s understanding of Insertion Sort and recursion. If we take a closer look at Insertion Sort algorithm, we keep processed elements sorted and insert new elements one by one in the inserted array. Recursion Idea.  Base Case: If array size is 1 or smaller, return.  Recursively sort first n-1 elements.  Insert last element at its correct position in sorted array.  Below is implementation of above idea.  C++  Java  Python  C#  PHP  Javascript  Output :  This article is contributed by Sahil Chhabra (akku).
