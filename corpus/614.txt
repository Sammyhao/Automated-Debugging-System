To get the output you want, you're best off getting the contents of the array and using with the option:  The option requires Tcl 8.6.  In older versions of Tcl, you have to pack things up into a of tuples:  Note that Tcl 8.4 is unsupported software, not even for security issues, and that 8.5 has only got a year or two more extended support lifetime left. There's a limit to how long we'll hold people's hands…  @user42556 Added; it needs packing into a list of tuples first. Thankfully you're not on 8.3 or before, as those lacked the option, making all this much more annoying…  what you want to do is to transform the array into a list, step over it in pairs and sort the pairs based on the number:  Get a flat list of the interleaved keys and values using .  From it, produce a list of key/value pairs—a list of lists.  Given that list, sort it using the command passing it the option which makes interpret the elements of the list it sorts as lists, and use their elements at index 1 (the 2nd position) for sorting.  To print out the elements of the sorted list, you need to extract the key and the value back from each of them. The easiest way is to use but if you have Tcl < 8.5 you can use either the trick or directly access the elements using and to get the key and the value, respectively.  By clicking “Accept all cookies”, you agree Stack Exchange can store cookies on your device and disclose information in accordance with our Cookie Policy.
