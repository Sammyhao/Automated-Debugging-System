I am passing a list named adj to a function . Can someone find out the error ?  as an argument simply isn't valid syntax. I don't know where you picked it up from, but it's simple to verify how to call a function.  1 Answer 1  You should try using some other container than list. As List containers are implemented as doubly-linked lists.  The main drawback of lists and forward_lists compared to these other sequence containers is that they lack direct access to the elements of their position; For example, to access the sixth element in a list, one has to iterate from a known position (like the beginning or the end) to that position, which takes linear time in the distance between these. (what you are trying to do in -)  They also consume some extra memory to keep the linking information associated with each element (which may be an important factor for large lists of small-sized elements).  Better use vector if you want direct access to the elements.  Another thing I would like to point out is - we never define arguments in the function call.  Thank You for taking your time to answer. Yes I am well aware about the last point .The whole point of me asking this question was to ask , how to pass a list container to a function . Ok i will try to use some other container.  By clicking “Accept all cookies”, you agree Stack Exchange can store cookies on your device and disclose information in accordance with our Cookie Policy.
