I am having trouble with it. I first checked one HashTable entry, and then iterating the linked list it points at. As far as my tracking of this key iterator, the logic should be right. Here is what it looks like:  However, in the test program I wrote,  I got results like this  The displayTable is just a method in the HashTable class that used to test iterater methods. It looks like this:  Why this keyIterator method work like this? Any help would be really appreciated!  1 Answer 1  First of all, it makes no sense for your key iterator to increment . Since that variable is not an instance variable of the class, I'm assuming it's an instance variable of the enclosing class. It should only be modified when you add or remove element to the hash table.  Another issue is that is not enough to track the position of the current key. You need the index of the current entry in the + the current link in the linked list of the current entry. This will allow you to iterate to the next link in that linked list in constant time.  369k4949 gold badges651651 silver badges720720 bronze badges  1  That makes sense. I misused numberOfEntries as the index of current link in the linked list. I add another counter to track the link and made some changes to the next() method, but I still got an error. I will update the new method and the error in my question.
