You can use compiler flags to catch it (clang++ has sanitizers, and Visual C++ has debug mode for containers, and G++ has has debug mode enabled with -D_GLIBCXX_DEBUG ). Also, you can replace all your usages of the with method, and that will catch the issue earlier.  why am i getting this message and how do i fix it? -- Debug your code locally. Just create a function and add the test data.  2 Answers 2  i found my error ! it was because of a missing boundary check for the newly calculated coordinate and improper boundary check for a coordinate in the beginning of psUtil.  Your method is pretty good, but maybe we can improve on the implementation a bit. Here is an accepted solution with a similar DFS method.  I'm not also sure, if this would be the most efficient algorithm for the Pacific Atlantic Water Flow problem. You can check out the discussion board.  References  For additional details, you can see the Discussion Board. There are plenty of accepted solutions, explanations, efficient algorithms with a variety of languages, and time/space complexity analysis in there.  By clicking “Accept all cookies”, you agree Stack Exchange can store cookies on your device and disclose information in accordance with our Cookie Policy.
