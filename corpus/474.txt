 your communities  Find centralized, trusted content and collaborate around the technologies you use most.  Connect and share knowledge within a single location that is structured and easy to search.  and I'm trying to find (collect) all vertices reachable from a certain starting point (vertex) sorted by their distance. That means I'd like to create a list of all vertices reachable from a certain starting vertex where "nearer" vertices are stored earlier in the list/vector. Therefore I (think I) need BFS.  Unfortunately I failed to find out how to do that without compile error:  this leads to the following errors:  My questions:  Can anyone shed some light on my mistake? Or maybe a pointer to an example?  Is there possibly a better (in terms of efficiency) or different approach to reach that goal?  (I though about using "connected_components" first... but it uses DFS which cannot fulfill the distance/sorting criteria I have).  1 Answer 1  The docs say that the Buffer needs to be a queue of . You accidentally declared it to have (the vertex property bundle) as the value type.  340k4545 gold badges424424 silver badges582582 bronze badges  4  Thanks. I also had to replace the std::ref(Q) with just Q... two mistakes in one line. OMG  LOL. Just a last question: When using bundled vertices/edges all examples I've seen even single (lets say) uint32_t in a struct. Are there any restrictions why I cannot use the uint32_t directly?  No restrictions. Just good practice. Why make your code significantly less versatile and non-conventional?  By clicking “Accept all cookies”, you agree Stack Exchange can store cookies on your device and disclose information in accordance with our Cookie Policy.
