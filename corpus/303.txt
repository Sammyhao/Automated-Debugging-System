This code works but I am wondering if this is the correct way to go about this problem.  "but I am wondering if this is the correct way to go about this problem" Certainly not. Recursion is the completely wrong approach.  @n.m. depends on the representation of empty list. NULL is not the only possibility. with head sentinels, yes it would work.  1 Answer 1  What the data type is and whether it includes some data fields that you need to somehow initialize. Currently a default constructor will be called, so all nodes in the linked list, added using your function, will be the same. That may or may not be OK. (Depending on what your prof had in mind. This is a homework question after all).  Another issue that is not quite clear, is that you assume the linked list is always non-empty. If head is null your function will not work. I doubt that this is OK.  The node is simply a struct with a field for an int and of course a pointer to the next node. Our test code given assumes main has a head pointer that points to a node.  By clicking “Accept all cookies”, you agree Stack Exchange can store cookies on your device and disclose information in accordance with our Cookie Policy.
