I've been given the HashTable.h file which came from our textbook and as you'll see, it is designed to be able to handle any object.  I'm trying to insert my object via:  However, I'm getting these errors:  Would you guys mind taking a look?  EDIT: When I try to insert by value as many of you suggested, I get back a ton of garbage but parsed out for errors there are two:  @user2704533 Well I'm afraid you'll have to understand the error messages instead of trying blindly. Focus on the first error you get and ignore the rest, that are most likely just follow-up errors!  After parsing through the 6 pages worth of stuff it threw back it me I got the following errors: /opt/local/include/gcc47/c++/bits/functional_hash.h:60:7: error: static assertion failed: std::hash is not specialized for this type and opt/local/include/gcc47/c++/bits/stl_algo.h:135:7: error: no match for 'operator==' in '__first.std::_List_iterator<_Tp>::operator*<Symbol>() == __val'  Does your textbook tell you that you need to provide a specialization for your class? No offense, but this is pretty advanced C++ stuff... Maybe you should try something simpler first?  Symbol] note: no known conversion for argument 1 from 'Symbol*' to 'Symbol&'  There is a version of that takes a reference as its argument. So instead of pointer insert the object by value:  This is telling you that you are calling with a and the function takes either a or a .  So, let's look at the code where you call :  Sure enough, you are using which is the which will take the address of , which is of type , returning a pointer to it (which is, of course, of type ). So you're calling the function with , which is not what the functions expect.  Sidenote: your implementation has a few other issues that you will need to sort through. Ask yourself what is and what does the class do with the l- and r-value references to that it accepts?  By clicking “Accept all cookies”, you agree Stack Exchange can store cookies on your device and disclose information in accordance with our Cookie Policy.
