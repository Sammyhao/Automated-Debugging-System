I am checking if a tree can even be made given the inorder and preorder traversal through a boolean possible.  My code to build tree is as below  What are the cases I am missing ?How can this be done?  I know how to construct tree from valid traversals,I want to know if the given traversals(which maybe invalid) are of the same tree?  1 Answer 1  Question says "check if the given preorder ,inorder and postorder traversals are of the same binary tree?". You are creating a tree from inorder and preorder and then checking its postorder traversal with given postorder. Here you are assuming that inorder and preorder will always be of same tree. Which is not necessarily true. Inoder and postorder might be of same tree and preorder might be of different tree. Hence your code is getting runtime error.  Now for the current problem what we have to do is traverse tree formation logic from above two tree creation and see if we are landing at node with same value at every step. If at any step we encounter different values it means one of inorder, preorder or postorder traversal is incorrect.
