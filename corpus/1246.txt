And then reading 11 of them?  I'm still wondering why there is an array in this at all. You need two numbers (three if you include the loop counter): the one you just read, and the max so far. if the former is greater than the latter, gratz, you have a new max so assign it and move to the next iteration. There is nothing in your description whatsoever to indicate an array is warranted.  1 Answer 1  you are indexing two past the end of the array. you need to make the for condition this:  if(arr[i]>arr[i+1]) that part should be like that: if(arr[i]>max) and this part for(i=0;i<=10;i++) should be like that for(i=0;i<=9;i++)  By clicking “Accept all cookies”, you agree Stack Exchange can store cookies on your device and disclose information in accordance with our Cookie Policy.
