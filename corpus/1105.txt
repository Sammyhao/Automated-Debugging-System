I have used a sorting algorithm as mentioned in the question (to keep track of multiple occurrences) however the program shows runtime error for test cases beyond 30. Is there any mistake in the code or is it an issue with my compiler?  FWIW, I see no obvious mistakes. What's the exact run-time error you're getting, and what's the (smallest) input you use when you get that?  It is around 25 testcases, I am not sure whether it is an issue with the compiler itself or the code, but I do not see any outputs for testcases beyond 25.(screen is just blank)  Runtime error... could you provide the error identify the line it is thrown from?  By clicking “Accept all cookies”, you agree Stack Exchange can store cookies on your device and disclose information in accordance with our Cookie Policy.
