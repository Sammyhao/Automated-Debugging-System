 Binary Search Tree insert with Parent Pointer  We have discussed simple BST insert. How to insert in a tree where parent pointer needs to be maintained. Parent pointers are helpful to quickly find ancestors of a node, LCA of two nodes, successor of a node, etc.  In recursive calls of simple insertion, we return pointer of root of subtree created in a subtree. So the idea is to store this pointer for left and right subtrees. We set parent pointers of this returned pointers after the recursive calls. This makes sure that all parent pointers are set during insertion. Parent of root is set to NULL. We handle this by assigning parent as NULL by default to all newly allocated nodes.  C++  Java  Python3  C#  Javascript  Output :  Exercise: How to maintain parent pointer during deletion.
