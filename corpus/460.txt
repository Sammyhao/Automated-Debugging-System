Can someone explain to me why this is returning "Unknown error" as output ? Thanks very much for helping me !  8,67488 gold badges4646 silver badges7474 bronze badges  1  It prints "FunnyError" for me, using Visual C++ 2010. Which compiler are you using?  2 Answers 2  The problem is with this line. Because with an expression uses the static type of that expression to determine the exception thrown, this slices the exception object constructing a new object copying only the base object part of the that is a reference to.  To re-throw the caught exception you should always use throw without an expression.  Charles, I thought that throw e; would call the copy constructor std::exception(const std::exception e), which would create a correct copy of the exception ? Is it not the case ?  Yes, it uses 's copy constructor. No, this won't necessarily result in a 'correct' copy of the exception as is only the base class of the exception that actually refers to.  Thank you for the complete answer, I have been taught to always rethrow using throw, while investigating an issue, I was curious about why the message returned by what() was not preserved. Thanks to you I know the reason, Charles !  By clicking “Accept all cookies”, you agree Stack Exchange can store cookies on your device and disclose information in accordance with our Cookie Policy.
