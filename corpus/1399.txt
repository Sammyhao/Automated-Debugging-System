 Write a Program to Find the Maximum Depth or Height of a Tree  Given a binary tree, find height of it. Height of empty tree is -1, height of tree with one node is 0 and height of below tree is 2.  Recursively calculate height of left and right subtrees of a node and assign height to the node as max of the heights of two children plus 1. See below pseudo code and program for details. Algorithm:  See the below diagram for more clarity about execution of the recursive function maxDepth() for above example tree.  Implementation:  C++  C  Java  Python3  C#  Javascript  Output  Time Complexity: O(n) (Please see our post Tree Traversal for details)  Method 2: Another method to solve this problem is to do Level Order Traversal. While doing the level order traversal, while adding Nodes at each level to Queue, we have to add NULL Node so that whenever it is encountered, we can increment the value of variable and that level get counted.  Writing code in comment?
