When I search for that, there is any solution to return that object?  If or is , you can't (or shouldn't) return a non-const pointer. Change the return type of the function to .  References come to a great use here. Typically returning a local pointer is not a good idea. An example for your case is given below. Two problems with your the code: (a) not all paths return value and (b) hash table should locate quickly (ideally O(1)), so looping is a bad idea. Further, is not being incremented in the loop.  I want to be able to do this so I can do Ticket t1 = findTicketByFan(id);  If it is your intention, return type is not correct, it should return by value or (const) reference, not pointer. Another issue, you use and try to search in a loop, but you should use instead:  if creating temporary ticket is too expensive, you should use instead and use id as a key. Then this function would be:  'it' variable's type neither a Ticket, neither a Ticket*, it's a pair which contains key and value variables, you are using it wrong, probably you need to write:  By clicking “Accept all cookies”, you agree Stack Exchange can store cookies on your device and disclose information in accordance with our Cookie Policy.
