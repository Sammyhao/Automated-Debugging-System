The idea is to store multiple items of the same type together. This makes it easier to calculate the position of each element by simply adding an offset to a base value, i.e., the memory location of the first element of the array (generally denoted by the name of the array). The diagrammatic representation of the Array is given below:  Program 1: Below is an illustration of a 1D array:  C++  Java  Python3  C#  Javascript  C++  Java  Python3  C#  Javascript  Output:  Map:  A map is an associative container that stores elements in a mapped fashion. Each element has a key value and a mapped value. No two mapped values can have equal key values.  The diagrammatic representation of Map is given below:  C++  Java  Writing code in comment?
