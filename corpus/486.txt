 Find smallest and largest elements in singly linked list  Given a singly linked list of n nodes and find the smallest and largest elements in linked list. Examples:  The idea is to traverse the linked list while head not equal to NULL and initialise the max and min variable to INT_MIN and INT_MAX respectively. After that check a condition that if max value is less then head value is assigned to max or min value is greater then head value is assigned to min otherwise head point to next node. Continue this process until head not equal to NULL.  C++  Java  Python  C#  Javascript  Output:  This article is contributed by Dharmendra kumar.
