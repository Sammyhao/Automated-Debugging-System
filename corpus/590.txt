 your communities  Find centralized, trusted content and collaborate around the technologies you use most.  Connect and share knowledge within a single location that is structured and easy to search.  I can't figure this out. My search tree only saves the first entry from the input list. I want to build pre, inline, and post traversals along with with some other functions (this will be done after I fix this mess).  There are many solutions, but I want to get better, so I want to know what is wrong with what I did.  1 Answer 1  The traverse go right when ID to add is smaller than current node's ID.  On the other hand, in your node-searching function  The traverse go left when ID to search is smaller than current node's ID.  This mismatch is preventing IDs of nodes other than the root (1st on the list) node from being found.  You have to invert either choice to solve this issue.  By clicking “Accept all cookies”, you agree Stack Exchange can store cookies on your device and disclose information in accordance with our Cookie Policy.
