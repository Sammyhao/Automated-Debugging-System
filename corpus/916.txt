I've been trying to sort it with an anonymous function when using the map method like this:  but it doesn't seem to work. Am I way off base here in how I'm trying to implement this, or is there just a problem with my code?  1 Answer 1  Sorting generally takes more than one iteration by itself. It's almost certainly O(n log n) for the average case (the algorithm isn't specified by ECMAScript, but that's the best you can do with a comparison sort), so there's not much point in doing both at the same time.  You can chain them into one expression though, since returns the array itself:  By clicking “Accept all cookies”, you agree Stack Exchange can store cookies on your device and disclose information in accordance with our Cookie Policy.
