Things like : and why take ?  Your question seems to be a lack of understanding what is, and since this code doesn't explain that, why don't you go back to where you found this, and have another look?  I know what an adjacency matrix is. I just dont understand why the number of nodes is being counted in this way.  Are you asking "why the "? If so, it's because whoever wrote the code decided to do it that way.  You could remove , and the on the next line, and change to , and it would function the same. --- But I would say that the code is wrong, since should start at 0, not at .  1 Answer 1  BFS is a short form for Breadth-First-Search. Starting from a source vertex, the direct neighbours are processed first, followed by the direct neighbours of those and so on.  The 4th line is not needed as you can simply print directly. should start at 0 as you are trying to iterate through the possible neighbours of the current vertex (represented by).  By clicking “Accept all cookies”, you agree Stack Exchange can store cookies on your device and disclose information in accordance with our Cookie Policy.
