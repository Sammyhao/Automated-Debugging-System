I am trying to code a heap sort that takes input from user in an array and heap sorts it but i can not find a way to implement user input array in my code. at the end, in the main function, i have to use array arr[]={} but i either have to define the elements or the number of elements so it creates zeros if i define the array as arr[10]={} here is the code :  I'm not sure what your problem is. If you want to sort only the first 5 elements of the array, simply pass x instead of n (i.e., 5). The routine does not care whether a few more spare elements are lying behind the ones you use. That said, yes, follow DXZ's advice and use a vector. As an aside, the default initialization of the array with {} is unnecessary: The elements you use are overwritten anyway, the unused ones are, well, unused ...  1 Answer 1  You can consider std::vector and pass it by reference to your heapify(...) to save memory.  By clicking “Accept all cookies”, you agree Stack Exchange can store cookies on your device and disclose information in accordance with our Cookie Policy.
