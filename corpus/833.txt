 Iterators in C++ STL  Prerequisite : Introduction to Iterators Iterators are used to point at the memory addresses of STL containers. They are primarily used in sequence of numbers, characters etc. They reduce the complexity and execution time of program.  Operations of iterators :-  1. begin() :- This function is used to return the beginning position of the container.  2. end() :- This function is used to return the after end position of the container.  Output:  3. advance() :- This function is used to increment the iterator position till the specified number mentioned in its arguments.  Output:  4. next() :- This function returns the new iterator that the iterator would point after advancing the positions mentioned in its arguments.  5. prev() :- This function returns the new iterator that the iterator would point after decrementing the positions mentioned in its arguments.  Output:  6. inserter() :- This function is used to insert the elements at any position in the container. It accepts 2 arguments, the container and iterator to position where the elements have to be inserted.  This article is contributed by Manjeet Singh .If you like GeeksforGeeks and would like to contribute, you can also write an article using write.geeksforgeeks.org or mail your article to review-team@geeksforgeeks.org.
