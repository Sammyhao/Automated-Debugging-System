Is there any method to do it?  Of course there is a syntax like  but it doesn't solve this problem. I want to make general pointer, not specifying the base class for it - only pointer for "operator function"  1 Answer 1  No, you can't do this. The class type is a part of the type of the operator member function.  The type of is different from the type of . The former is of type while the latter is of type .
