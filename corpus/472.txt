However, when I try to run the code as a function I am greeted by 'Fatal Runtime Error'.  From this I assume that I am setting up the function incorrectly. Am I missing something incredibly obvious?  I've been using 2 words separated by a space i.e. 'smelly cheese'. If I comment out the functions within main then the program runs and outputs the words 1 char at a time  2 Answers 2  passes the twenty-seventh element of the array to the function, converted to a pointer. First of all, your index is out of bounds of the array, secondly passing a single character converted to a pointer will not pass a valid pointer.  you are referring to a location which is you are not supposed to. actually does not exists. is an array of size length whose index starts from and end with .  The way you are passing the array is inappropriate, this way you will be sending only one value to the function and the function definition is bound to receive an array, this also leads to an error.  The better way to send an array is , where array1 being my array variable.  By clicking “Accept all cookies”, you agree Stack Exchange can store cookies on your device and disclose information in accordance with our Cookie Policy.
