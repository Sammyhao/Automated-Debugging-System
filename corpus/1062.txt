I think I have it, but when I try to compile, I get the error "expected primary-expression before ']' token" for both recursive calls. Does anyone know why this is occurring?  My function:  Where a[] is the sorted array, size is the size of the array, and val is the value being searched for.  Thanks, that worked. It's an assignment so I can't used standard libraries, unfortunately.  You still have some problems to resolve. You probably need to delineate the range more clearly, maybe with , so that you can recurse and search the correct sub-range of the array. Just passing a single number means that you'll always be searching , even if the value can only be found in the upper half of the array.  Welcome to SO. This is an old question, so you may not get many responses for your answer.  Your code has a critical bug. When writing such algorithms, you should spend some time to list test cases. To test comprehensively, I'd write a couple loops that would check all the following combinations:  check it works for 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 input elements (with element values spaced apart so you can search for values between existing elements), seeking an element less-than/equal/greater-than each of those elements  Here's some sample code for a test harness, just to get you started...  Even if you work through a couple such cases in your head you're likely to find the bug.  By clicking “Accept all cookies”, you agree Stack Exchange can store cookies on your device and disclose information in accordance with our Cookie Policy.
