 BFS using STL for competitive coding  A STL based simple implementation of BFS using queue and vector in STL. The adjacency list is represented using vectors of vector.  Below is an example BFS starting from source vertex 1. Note that there can be multiple BFSs possible for a graph (even from a particular vertex).  For more details of BFS, refer this post . The code here is simplified such that it could be used in competitive coding.  CPP  This article is contributed by Nikhil Mahendran.
