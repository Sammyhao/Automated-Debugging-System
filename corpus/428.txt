Presumably, it should look something like this;  2,8791313 gold badges3636 silver badges6767 bronze badges  1  1  Check export_graphviz function by which you can convert .dot to other formats such as .png  use to create an image file. When I ran it on your code without an argument I got a but you can specify a different file name. There is also a shortcut , which saves the file and opens it in an appropriate viewer application.  If you paste the code as it is in a rich terminal (such as Spyder/IPython with inline graphics or a Jupyter notebook) it will automagically display the image instead of the object's Python representation.  I'm working in Windows 10. I solved this by adding to the 'path' environment variable. I added the wrong path, I added Drive:\Users\User.Name\AppData\Local\Continuum\anaconda3\envs\MyVirtualEnv\lib\site-packages\graphviz should have used Drive:\Users\User.Name\AppData\Local\Continuum\anaconda3\envs\MyVirtualEnv\Library\bin\graphviz in the end I used both, then restarted python/anaconda. Also added the pydotplus path, which is in ....MyVirtualEnv\lib\site-packages\pydotplus.  Jupyter will show the graph as is, but if you want to zoom in more you can try to save the file and inspect further :  By clicking “Accept all cookies”, you agree Stack Exchange can store cookies on your device and disclose information in accordance with our Cookie Policy.
