Can anyone help?  Why do you want to sort an unordered map? If you need the data to be sorted, use a regular map. (P.S: You wont be able to sort it in-place. It would break the invariants of the map)  1 Answer 1  This is impossible from both a compilation and logical standpoint. From a type standpoint, requires:  -RandomIt must meet the requirements of ValueSwappable and RandomAccessIterator. -The type of dereferenced RandomIt must meet the requirements of MoveAssignable and MoveConstructible.  The iterator type on is a ForwardIterator, not a RandomAccessIterator, so the first requirement is unsatisfied. The type of the dereferenced iterator is , which is not MoveAssignable (can't assign to ), so the second requirement is also unsatisfied.  From a logical standpoint, sorting an unordered container makes no sense. It's unordered. And the complexity guarantees that is able to achieve require a very specific ordering that you shouldn't be, and aren't, allowed to mess with.  Hi thanks for the answer, I really like the way of the first reason to explain that. I am in the transit from novice to intermedia, could you give some suggestion on what kind of resources to look at such that we could explain issues in a more solid way like you did here?@Barry  By clicking “Accept all cookies”, you agree Stack Exchange can store cookies on your device and disclose information in accordance with our Cookie Policy.
