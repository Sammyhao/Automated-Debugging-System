You'll need to create the map beforehand, insert into it with , and insert the map itself into the .  From the code given in the question it looks like you want to create a Queue for which each element of Queue is a group of two other elements. This can be easily done using class template "pair" or "tuple".  For pair[1] you write while for tuple[2]  Tuple is generalization of pair where more than two members can form group. What I feel is wrong in your code is that you are initializing a map but not using it as a Map, you want to push individual elements of Map in Queue which demolish the purpose of creating a Map. Pair and Tuple create individual objects which can be treated separately from other similar objects, they act similar to as using struct to form group of different data types.  By clicking “Accept all cookies”, you agree Stack Exchange can store cookies on your device and disclose information in accordance with our Cookie Policy.
