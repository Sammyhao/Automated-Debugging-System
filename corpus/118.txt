This implementation would return '5' (the middle index).  To understand the algorithm, just step through the code in a debugger.  As pointed out by @Pleepleus it will return the index 5 from the first level of recursion itself. However I would like to point out few things about binary search :  Instead of using , use  If you want to search for or of an element use the following algorithms:  For the sake of completeness here's an example in typescript, non-recursive version (binary operators are used to enforce operations on integers rather than floating-point arithmetic) Example is easily convertible to other C-like languages:  By clicking “Accept all cookies”, you agree Stack Exchange can store cookies on your device and disclose information in accordance with our Cookie Policy.
