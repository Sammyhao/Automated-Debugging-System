The set's iterator returns the keys in ascending order  i want to implement iterable interface.. will the declaration be "private class myIterator implements Iterator<K> " ?  It is true that doesn't preserve insertion order. But, you might use of which the Javadoc says (in part)  Hash table and linked list implementation of the interface, with predictable iteration order.  so basically its the same implementation of linked list, just using get(object key)?  The second sentence in the first Javadoc link says This implementation differs from HashMap in that it maintains a doubly-linked list running through all of its entries. There is also a (which is sorted by the keys).  You can copy the entries from the to a collection that preserves order (like a ) and then sort them based on the keys (in reverse order). You say that you want to sort the keys in descending order, so I assume that the key implements but since I don't know what the type is of your key, I used type parameters and as placeholders.  By clicking “Accept all cookies”, you agree Stack Exchange can store cookies on your device and disclose information in accordance with our Cookie Policy.
