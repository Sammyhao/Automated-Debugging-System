I don't have an idea how to add edge cost for the each vertex being added to the path. I will post code for your reference. Provide me some suggestions.  Graph.java  Main.java  city.txt  this is my bfs part of my code which i have tested without adding any edgecost  my question is how do I add the edgecost to code in bfs part and provide the path cost from source to destination when executed.  Though it is great that you shared your code, can you please what the question is exactly? I am guessing you need to run BFS on a graph with weighted edges (or maybe weighted nodes?). Please explain  Yes. Right now I can run the bfs given source and destination, without including cost so it provides me an path. Similarly I want the bfs to take edgecost as well and provide me the cost to reach the destination from source. Example if city1->city3->city5 is the path, the cost associated shoulld be 11  1 Answer 1  To return the path and the cost you will need to create a class to hold both values:  Your search should then return a from .  Your code would be a lot more readable if you split your classes up more.  Once you've done that you'll find that it's a lot more obvious where to add logic that's related to a particular class and the data you need will be available when you need it. For example, it's now trivial to convert a to a total cost:  This is much cleaner code than having to pass the original graph around to find the cost of an edge.  By clicking “Accept all cookies”, you agree Stack Exchange can store cookies on your device and disclose information in accordance with our Cookie Policy.
