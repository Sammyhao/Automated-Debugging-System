Suppose the name of the array is IndexLookupArray, if you want to lookup the index of a node with ID x you can find it in IndexLookupArray[x]. And the rest of the code should be the same. If the range of the numbers is unknown or if it's too big to fit in an array, you can store the indices in a hash map for example and do the same thing.  Thanks , i have maintained a map and reversemap map to put value ,,, reversemap to find the key,which will be our desired path codeshare.io/50XZMn BUT I WANT TO USE BI-DIRECTIONAL MAP How to use that  By clicking “Accept all cookies”, you agree Stack Exchange can store cookies on your device and disclose information in accordance with our Cookie Policy.
