 Java Program for Binary Search (Recursive and Iterative)  So as we all know binary search is one of the searching algorithms that is most frequently applied while dealing with data structures where the eccentric goal is not to traverse the whole array. Here array must be sorted as we check the middle element and ignore the half of the array which is of no use as per the number system. We basically ignore half of the elements just after one comparison. So do we keep on iterating till the element is found or land upon a conclusion that element is not present n the array.  Algorithms:  Compare x with the middle element.  If x matches with the middle element, we return the mid index.  Else If x is greater than the mid element, then x can only lie in the right half subarray after the mid element. So we recur for the right half.  Writing code in comment?
