 Recursive function to delete k-th node from linked list  Given a singly linked list, delete a node at the kth position without using the loop.  We recursively reduce the value of k. When k reaches 1, we delete the current node and return the next current node as a new node. When the function returns, we link the returned node to the next previous node.  C++  Java  Python3  C#  Javascript  Output:  ?list=PLqM7alHXFySH41ZxzrPNj2pAYPOI8ITe7 This article is contributed by Mohd Saleem.
