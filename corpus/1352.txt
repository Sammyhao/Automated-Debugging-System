Just copy this code and paste and you're ready to go:  I didn't do anything, I just read the input outside the function.  Issue that you have only one problem : 1. You just need to sum all elements of given array , Just sum , you don't need to read input from User.That's what i changed in your code , then remove everything and write code after i modified and should work and Everything will be fine.  By clicking “Accept all cookies”, you agree Stack Exchange can store cookies on your device and disclose information in accordance with our Cookie Policy.
