Any ideas why this is happening? I've tried changing the value of N (initially with a larger value it was giving me TLE) and "ints" to "long longs" but nothing seems to be working. I wrote my attempt based on the official analysis so I would have thought it would pass, although this is the first time I try using segment trees so maybe I'm missing something obvious with the implementation. Any help would be much appreciated.  Show the full error message. Also trim down your code. Also use meaningful variable names.  @tadman As far as I can tell there is no error message on the google kickstart platform. It literally just says "RE". If I hover on top of this, it says "Runtime Error".  Sounds like undefined behaviour. Bugs don't have to behave consistently. Given how you do zero bounds checking in here it's not surprising that there's undefined behaviour. Some checks might be in order.  Use the debugger - or if you're not used to it - litter your code with debug print outs. I confess - that's still my first "goto" debugging solution.  By clicking “Accept all cookies”, you agree Stack Exchange can store cookies on your device and disclose information in accordance with our Cookie Policy.
