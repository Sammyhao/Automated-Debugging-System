What exactly is a pointer chasing and how is it related to BFS?  4,3571616 gold badges6363 silver badges118118 bronze badges  3  1  chase pointers. 1. vi.

BFS (breadth first search) is an algorithm to search in that graph.  Pointer chasing is just another word for following lots of pointers.  From the hardware perspective (CPU), pointer-chasing is bad for performance because memory reads are in effect serialized in the CPU (ie no ILP). You can't start a read (ie a load instr) until the prior one is done (since the prior load gives us the address for the next load and so on....).  Lets say we have a with 5 elements. To get to the 3rd element, you have to use to traverse through the elements.  By clicking “Accept all cookies”, you agree Stack Exchange can store cookies on your device and disclose information in accordance with our Cookie Policy.
