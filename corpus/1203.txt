You can use getRange for doing that. Just be aware that the map context.values JSON changes the join order on your results (field.join vs join.field) compared to a loaded search.  Go to the script deployment and hit edit. Then select "Save and Execute".  The debugger is waiting for you to trigger the map reduce script.
