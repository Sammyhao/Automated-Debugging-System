Any suggestions, Thanx  Got something that compiles ? There is no function in this code yet it is called from , nor is there a class/struct called , nor a global called . Post the real code please.  My psychic debugger tells me the constructor for never sets to NULL, and clearly the rest of this code doesn't either. Your constructor should take a single data element and initialize both the member and , such as  3 Answers 3  in the else part of your insertHelper. As for "suggestions" part, avoid processing lists recursively if you can help it. Your (future) coworkers won't appreciate it.  4,98522 gold badges1414 silver badges2323 bronze badges  1  +1 (though it is actually an indeterminate pointer, not a dangling pointer. A dangler is a pointer that was at one time valid, then released/freed, leaving something that is then invalid). Also, a decent constructor would better address this, as it would ensure all instances of have an initialized pointer; not just the one created here.  Each time you insert a new node you have to set the next value of that new node to NULL. Otherwise your insertHelper will get some junk pointer value each time you call it.  By clicking “Accept all cookies”, you agree Stack Exchange can store cookies on your device and disclose information in accordance with our Cookie Policy.
