This function should make a copy of the array, sort the copy, and return a pointer to the sorted copy. I tried but I get strange output. I'm sure it has something to do with the pointer but still can't figure it out.  Dumping an array of pointer-to- in to an array of isn't a good start to whatever you're trying to do. Also, you're not actually copying to capacity anyway. The third argument to is a size in bytes; not an element count. And finally, "returning a sorted copy" is going to involve either an additional in/out parameter, a static array, or some dynamic allocation.  you are returning an adress of a local variable which deletes after funcion closure  1 Answer 1  Well, the second parameter of must be the number of elements of array passed as first parameter, and not its (the size of the object in memory bytes) I'm supposing you are using a 32 bit architecture, where an is four bytes wide, and you are passing as the array number of elements, not which is the actual number of cells in the array.  By clicking “Accept all cookies”, you agree Stack Exchange can store cookies on your device and disclose information in accordance with our Cookie Policy.
