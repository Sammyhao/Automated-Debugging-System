The aim is to reverse the order of the range. Can anyone help with what the error is here?  1 Answer 1  In most of the cases, you don't need to select the worksheet. You may want to see THIS  Do not use to construct your range. Use to do it by finding the last row which has data. You may want to see THIS  Combining both the above, your code can look like the below. Please try it.

I copied this code exactly into mine and it still comes up with "Run-Time Error 1004:The sort reference is not valid. Make sure that it's within the data that you want to sort, and the first Sort By box isn't the same or blank." What's really odd is that when I run it on one sheet only by changing With ThisWorkbook.Sheets(i) to With ThisWorkbook.Sheets("Sheetname") it works fine, but when I put it into the above structure to run over multiple ones as per your code it doesn't.
