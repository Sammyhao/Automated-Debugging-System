 Python Program for Binary Search (Recursive and Iterative)  In a nutshell, this search algorithm takes advantage of a collection of elements that is already sorted by ignoring half of the elements after just one comparison.  Compare x with the middle element.  If x matches with the middle element, we return the mid index.  Else if x is greater than the mid element, then x can only lie in the right (greater) half subarray after the mid element. Then we apply the algorithm again for the right half.  Else if x is smaller, the target x must lie in the left (lower) half. So we apply the algorithm for the left half.  Python3  Output:  Iterative:  Writing code in comment?
