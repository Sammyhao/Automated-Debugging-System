There's no way it could be even mutually tail recursive, as calls multiple times. It's hard to make DFS tail recursive, as the recursive algorithm relies heavily on the call stack to keep track of your position in the tree. I would suggest not bothering if you can guarantee that your tree is shallow. Otherwise, you will need to pass around an explicit stack ( is a good choice here) and completely rewrite your code.  You must essentially manually manage the stack if you want to implement DFS tail-recursively:  By clicking “Accept all cookies”, you agree Stack Exchange can store cookies on your device and disclose information in accordance with our Cookie Policy.
