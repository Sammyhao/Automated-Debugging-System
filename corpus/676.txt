 How to Iterate LinkedList in Java?  LinkedList in java is basically a part of the collection framework present in java.util package. It is the implementation of the LinkedList data structure that stores elements in a non-contiguous manner inside the memory.  Java  Output  Method 2: Using while Loop  We can iterate our LinkedList using a while loop in a very similar way as we did using a for loop.  Java  Output  Method 3: Using enhanced for loop  Using enhanced for loop we can sequentially iterate a LinkedList. The execution of the enhanced for loop ends after we visit all the elements. Let us see an example of iterating the LinkedList using the enhanced for loop.  Java  Output  Method 4: Using Iterator  To iterate the LinkedList using the iterator we first create an iterator to the current list and keep on printing the next element using the next() method until the next element exists inside the LinkedList.  We check if the LinkedList contains the next element using the hasNext() method.  Java  Output  Method 5: Using forEach() method  forEach() method was introduced in Java8.  It performs the specified task for each element of the Iterable until all elements have been processed or the action throws an exception.  Writing code in comment?
