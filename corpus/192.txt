However, I am finding it extremely difficult to create an ordered linked list. I managed to find the code to create a linked list online, however, I have no idea how I would begin making a Ordered linked list. I am relatively new to the language am finding the creation of this very stressful.  Any suggestions as to how I would go about its creation using the Linked List structure below?  I'm rather new to C++ and this is one of the first data structures i've every worked with, so sorry for the rather vague question.  If I were to phrase this into a solidified question, it would be this: how do I go about creating an ordered linked list using this code as a general base?  Do you have a specific issue you're having with this code? It seems like you're looking for general feedback, not for help with a specific problem you're running into.  Suppose you have a linked list that is sorted. Do you know how to insert a new element in the correct position?  @StephenNewell The specific issue is that I need to produce an Ordered Linked List not just a generic Linked List, and I'm not entirely sure how to go about that.  1 Answer 1  If it's a list you want, just use the standard one. Insert elements like this:  There are other containers that might be even better suited for your purposes, like or a "heapified" std::vector. Study the standard library containers and algorithms.  By clicking “Accept all cookies”, you agree Stack Exchange can store cookies on your device and disclose information in accordance with our Cookie Policy.
