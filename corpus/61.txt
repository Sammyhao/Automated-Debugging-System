 Array Representation Of Binary Heap  A Binary Heap is a Complete Binary Tree. A binary heap is typically represented as array. The representation is done as:  The root element will be at Arr[0].  Below table shows indexes of other nodes for the ith node, i.e., Arr[i]:  Arr[(2*i)+1]  Returns the left child node  The traversal method use to achieve Array representation is Level Order Binary Heap satisfies the Ordering Property. The Ordering can be of two types: 1. Min Heap Property: The value of each node is greater than or equal to the value of its parent, with the minimum value at the root.  Examples:  2. Max Heap Property: The value of each node is less than or equal to the value of its parent, with the maximum value at the root.  This article is contributed by Saksham Raj Seth.
