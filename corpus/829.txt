But I want the iterator to behave something like this :  Basically, the outer loop should start terminate at the last but one postion and the inner loop must start iterating from where the outer-loop iterator is. But this code does not seem to work.(No Match for + in it+1) is not defined Any help would be much appreciated. (Please point out any duplicate links as I could not find one for map.) Thanks !  @PiotrS. Thanks a lot. What if it had to start from 5 positions ahead of the previous iterator ?  2 Answers 2  The is a bidirectional iterator, which means it does not provide neither (only and in both prefix and postifx form).  In c++11 it is still possible to shift the iterator using or :  In c++03 you can use instead to move forward/backward by a given interval (the difference is that it operates on an actual object rather than creates a copy like ):  Both methods provide the most optimal way to increment/decrement a given iterator (based on that iterator's traits).  By clicking “Accept all cookies”, you agree Stack Exchange can store cookies on your device and disclose information in accordance with our Cookie Policy.
