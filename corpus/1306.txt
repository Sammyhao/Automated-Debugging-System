I've already implemented 8 tools (which are brush, rectangle, oval, polygon, triangle, line, spray and filler tool). Now I want to make a "bucket" tool which must fill the area around itself. I use DFS algorithm for this tool but when the area is large, gdb give below errors:  Does anyone know what does this error mean? You can see bucket.h and bucket.cpp below:  Is that a full stack gdb gives you (only 1 frame)? Hard to say but maybe it's as simple as stack overflow (as it happens only for big areas and DFS() is called recursively)?  1 Answer 1  It's stack overflow. If you fill a large space which has a simple shape (like a rectangle), the depth of recursion will be roughly equal to the area of that space, because it will almost always go to some branch and not return.  That is if image is e.g 1000x1000, the depth of recursion is about one million, which is too much.  You shouldn't use DFS for flood-filling, use BFS instead.  By clicking “Accept all cookies”, you agree Stack Exchange can store cookies on your device and disclose information in accordance with our Cookie Policy.
