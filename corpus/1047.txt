Ill try it right away , the programm i am trying to work is an anagram game as an excersise i have solved all the other parts that i compare the two arrays but needed to sort them first to compare.  @poseidon11 1. characters are integers. 2. You can come up with some sort of algorithm that compares objects based on their properties, else there wouldn't be generic sorting algorithms.  2 Answers 2  This is fundamental programming knowledge and you'd be doing yourself a favor by solving it yourself..  This isn't quick sort. Oh--after rereading I guess maybe he wasn't looking for the quick sort algorithm... just a "quick" sort. Lol.  thanks alot for the help i tryed bubble sort all day but i couldnt do it for some reason , finaly got it working with qsort :D  By clicking “Accept all cookies”, you agree Stack Exchange can store cookies on your device and disclose information in accordance with our Cookie Policy.
