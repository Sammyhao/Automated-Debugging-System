This question is too broad, in that sense...  I am generally interested about what is that design technique, I could not find more meaningful links from web. For example see following leetcode link. link This says, "here is my AC solution using formula". Not sure what does AC means here.  3 Answers 3  AC stands for "Accepted Code" and is commonly phrased as 'Here is my AC Solution' aka 'Here is my Accepted Code Solution.'  It is a term introduced to computer science by leetcode community üòÅ . It means Accepted Code but it is important to know why it could be not accepted, the common reasons are given here : https://stackoverflow.com/a/67863886/2815227  It looks like future generations will grap this phrase because almost everywhere asks new engineers algorithm questions and people practice on leetcode like places.  In the real world, there is nothing like that. It would be very funny to talk about your piece of software as "accepted code". There are terms like acceptance criteria and your software needs to meet them on top of passing your tests such as unit and integration tests.  By clicking ‚ÄúAccept all cookies‚Äù, you agree Stack Exchange can store cookies on your device and disclose information in accordance with our Cookie Policy.
