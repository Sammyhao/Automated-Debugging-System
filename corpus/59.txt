I declare an array of pointers of type struct node * should I give memory also to them.  4,8751616 gold badges4545 silver badges7171 bronze badges  3  Drop the asterix in the lvalue. The type should be a pointer, not a node. vertices[0] is a pointer. Also remove the casts.  @wildplasser I have a confusion here how will vertices[1] be stored because if I give all the memory to vertices[0] what I am trying to do is create an array vertices[0],vertices[1],vertices[2],vertices[3] and so on I am trying to use malloc for the same  You can remove the entire malloc() line. Vertices[] is an array of 20 pointers. The create_vertices() function will give the pointers a value (by calling malloc() plus a couple of assignments)  1 Answer 1  Also: it would be more safe to let the create_vertices() function know what the size of the array is. The i index should not be allowed to exceed this size.  UPDATE: in main, remove the line:  Vertices[] is an array of 20 (uninitialised) pointers in automatic storage ("on the stack").  The create_vertices() function will give the pointers a value. (by calling malloc() and assigning the result to vertices[i])  By clicking “Accept all cookies”, you agree Stack Exchange can store cookies on your device and disclose information in accordance with our Cookie Policy.
