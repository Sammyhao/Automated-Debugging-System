 Insertion and Deletion in Heaps  Given a Binary Heap and an element present in the given Heap. The task is to delete an element from this Heap.  The standard deletion operation on Heap is to delete the element present at the root node of the Heap. That is if it is a Max Heap, the standard deletion operation will delete the maximum element and if it is a Min heap, it will delete the minimum element.  Process of Deletion: Since deleting an element at any intermediary position in the heap can be costly, so we can simply replace the element to be deleted by the last element and delete the last element of the Heap.  Replace the root or element to be deleted by the last element.  Delete the last element from the Heap.  Since, the last element is now placed at the position of the root node. So, it may not follow the heap property. Therefore, heapify the last node placed at the position of root.  Illustration:  Implementation:  C++  Java  C#  Javascript  Python3  Output:  Insertion in Heaps  The insertion operation is also similar to that of the deletion process.  Given a Binary Heap and a new element to be added to this Heap. The task is to insert the new element to the Heap maintaining the properties of Heap.  Process of Insertion: Elements can be inserted to the heap following a similar approach as discussed above for deletion. The idea is to:  First increase the heap size by 1, so that it can store the new element.  Insert the new element at the end of the Heap.  This newly inserted element may distort the properties of Heap for its parents. So, in order to keep the properties of Heap, heapify this newly inserted element following a bottom-up approach.  Writing code in comment?
