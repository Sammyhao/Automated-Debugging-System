Its solution is to make the sum of the integer for example input 4, so 1+2+3+4 the output 10. For another example, the input is 10, so get sum of 1 to 10 to get in the output 55 and so on.  But when I used a list to store numbers and make sum(List), it gave me a "Memory limit exceeded".  Here is the code:  I tried another solution not to save in a list to avoid the memory exceeded, so I tried this:  But I get "Time limit exceeded". What is the solution to this problem?  Note that the range of number to the input and it will test on is 1≤ N ≤ 10^9. When I try the 10^9, it takes a really long time to get the answer.  Another note is that the time limit per test is 1 second.  1 Answer 1  This is an arithmetic progression and computes as S = ½(a1 + an)n, where a1 is first member, which is 1 in this case. an is the last member which is n in this case.  Output  4,57433 gold badges2020 silver badges2424 bronze badges  9  so what is should to do. write the full code that if i put it not to get any of these 2 bugs  @AmrKamal your second version is better, since there is no append to list. but use total += 1, and not total = total + 1. I have tested on python3. that is why range but not xrange.  n=int(raw_input()) sum=0 for i in xrange(1,n+1): sum+=1 print sum i write it like that but i not get the sum of 10 when i input 4 i want to get sum of 1+2+3+4 to get 10 any number make that to it and so on  you do not understand the problem is or the test i have to give input for example 4 i want to sum from 1 to 4 to get output 10 for another example input 10 to get sum from 1 to 10 the result will be in output 55 when i upload the 2 code in problem i get this 2 error memory exceed when i use list and time exceed when i use the second code that is it i want to solve this problem and in the problem say that time not exceed 1 second per test and not to exceed the memory limit per test is 64 megabyte ?  By clicking “Accept all cookies”, you agree Stack Exchange can store cookies on your device and disclose information in accordance with our Cookie Policy.
