After 899677 iterations(1:26:36 running time), GAMS shows  RESOURCE USAGE, LIMIT 1084.469 1000.000 ITERATION COUNT, LIMIT 900026 2000000000  MIP status(108): time limit exceeded, no integer solution Cplex Time: 1002.13sec (det. 849920.06 ticks) CPLEX Error 1217: No solution exists. Resource limit exceeded, no integer solution found. My PC has i7-8700 CPU @ 3.2GHZ and 32 RAM(has not been used up when calculation stop). How can I deal with this problem, or is it too big for GAMS?  1 Answer 1  By default, GAMS sets a time limit of 1000 seconds for a solve statement. You can increase this by changing the reslim option. There are three ways to do this (e.g. to set it to 3600 seconds):  On the command line when calling GAMS: gams resLim=3600  Using an option statement inside your model (influences all following solve statements): option resLim=3600;  Using a modelAttribute inside your model (influences all following solve statements for that particular model): modelName.resLim=3600;  2,01211 gold badge99 silver badges1111 bronze badges  1  @JiaweiLu: It sounds like this answer solves your problem.
