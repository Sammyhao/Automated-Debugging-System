Won't this work even when the array is not k-sorted?  2 Answers 2  Of course, this will not work when the array is not k-sorted.  Because the first element after sorting will always be the minimal elements among the first k+1 elements, and so on.  A : find k smallest numbers (not necessarily sorted) from an array: The method you think will work perfectly in time .  B : sorting the array: you find the minimum number from the heap of size k at each step , but what if the minimum number from the array is situated at index k + 2 ? You will not be able to get it placed in 1st step of your algorithm only , till the time you insert it you would have outputted 2 numbers arguing that they are than the original minimum .  so , you definately want to have them to be displaced by from their sorted position .  By clicking “Accept all cookies”, you agree Stack Exchange can store cookies on your device and disclose information in accordance with our Cookie Policy.
