Not only am I struggling with the algorithm I can't seen to get the while loop to fire. I am using the compareto() method to find the item in the list. The rest of the program works fine except this method. Any help or suggestions would be greatly appreciated.  A binary search works best when you have random access to a list. Are you sure using a binary search for a linked list make sense?  Peter, Using a binary search is a requirement for this assignment for a class. Kakarot, I'm not sure I know what you mean? mid is an integer used as the middle of the list's indexes. I'm splitting the list to break up the parts in two (binary) and also used as the index of the item in the linked list for the get() method. Getting the variables to be stable and update as needed is still another issue.  I think linear search is the quickest search algorithm for LinkedLists. And one advantage the list doesn't have to be sorted. (next time say it when it is for homework)  1 Answer 1  In the former version, the value false is assigned to , then the value of is tested but it's already false. So your loop never executes.  35.6k1212 gold badges6767 silver badges126126 bronze badges  1  Peter, thank you, that seems to help a little, at least now I get into the loop. Now I need to figure out the rest of the algorithm for bouncing back and forth doing the search.  By clicking “Accept all cookies”, you agree Stack Exchange can store cookies on your device and disclose information in accordance with our Cookie Policy.
