This check and assignment in :  are useless: if was NULL, you would have crashed already. Assigning is useless as it modifies a local variable immediately before returning from the function.  By clicking “Accept all cookies”, you agree Stack Exchange can store cookies on your device and disclose information in accordance with our Cookie Policy.
