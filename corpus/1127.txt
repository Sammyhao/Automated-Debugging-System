The algorithm that I've used is to get two strings with the help of DFS algorithm, sorting them and then comparing them.  This code works in visual studio 2010 but when I try to submit in UVA online judge I keep getting the Run Time Error and since I'm not a professional programmer I can't understand why.  I was also trying to optimize my code so I used short instead of int and scanf - printf instead of cin and cout.  I would appreciate some help on how to fix my code and also how to optimize it.  "I was also trying to optimize my code so I used short instead of int and scanf - printf instead of cin and cout." - Why are you doing any of these?  As a professional programmer I would look to optimize the algorithm not convert the input and output from c++ to c code.  Is it's runtime error than you shouldn't be optimizing your solution, but looking for the error. Unless you exceed the time limit.  By clicking “Accept all cookies”, you agree Stack Exchange can store cookies on your device and disclose information in accordance with our Cookie Policy.
