I think I would need to traverse through the list and print each element that way, but I don't know how I can use any of the list functions to do that. I thought about using the iterator functions, but that doesn't work since printBucket() is a constant member function, so I can't use things like startIterator().  Without the full code is hard to say, but why can't you just iterate up to and use ?  In addition, I am unsure what you mean by using the functions from -- you don't have access to those from the anyway.  Sorry, I just have to say that this design is rigid and grim, and exactly the reason exists (I assume this isn't yours, just warn against taking design tips from this). Anyway, if you just want to traverse the list you can do something like  By clicking “Accept all cookies”, you agree Stack Exchange can store cookies on your device and disclose information in accordance with our Cookie Policy.
