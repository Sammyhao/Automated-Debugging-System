 Insert a linked list into another linked list  Last Updated : 05 Jan, 2022  Given two linked lists, list1 and list2 of sizes m and n respectively. The task is to remove list1â€™s nodes from the ath node to the bth node and insert the list2 in their place. Examples:  Input: list1: 10->11->12->13->14->15, list2: 100->101->102->103, a = 3, b = 4 Output: 10->11->12->100->101->102->103->15 Explanation: Remove the nodes from 3rd index till 4th index (0-based) from list1 and insert list2 at their place.  Input: list1: 1->2, list2: 3->4, a = 0, b = 1 Output: 3->4  Approach: The task can be solved using simple iteration over the lists. Follow the below steps to solve the problem:  Start iterating over the linked list1 until the ath node  Now here take another variable and store the address of (a+1)th node of the list1 and link ath node to the list2 and then iterate over the list2 until the last node and just stop there  Iterate from (a+1)th node to the bth node of the list1 and then link the last node of the list2 to the (b+1) node of the list1.  Return the head node of the list1 and then print the whole list1 which will be the expected output.  Below is the implementation of the above approach:  C++  Output:  Time Complexity: O(m+n), n is the length of list1 and m is the length of list2 Auxiliary Space: O(1)  Writing code in comment?
