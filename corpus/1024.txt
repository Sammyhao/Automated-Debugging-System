Sadly, the Documentation is...well...not that good. Also, I'm not that good in C++ programming. Project setup in VisualStudio is some rocket science. anyways, settings are as follows:  VC++ Directories => Include Directories => added the include dir of the lib  VC++ Directories => Library Directories => added the lib dir, containing the .lib files  Linker => Input => Addit. Dependencies => added "proj.lib" and "proj_i.lib"  project is containing one cpp for testing purposes:  ...compiling like a charm...  When coming to , it crashes:  ignore brings up a second error:  ...the main problem is: where is the error? did i fail at compiling the library? OR did i fail my project setup?  compiling the library:  => run VCVARS32.BAT from visual studio tree, then  checked the C:\PROJ Directory: everything is there, copied the lib and include directories over to my project and tried it.  2 Answers 2  So, i got it working. Obviously the problem just occurs in debug mode. I switched to release mode, and it works.  my guess would be that the lib triggers a function that somehow kills the debug hook...  Looks like it expects a true heap pointer, try allocating a pointer with enough space for your string (remember the extra null byte!), strcpy to that, pass that.  should have answered myself, but the problem obviously vanishes in release mode...  By clicking “Accept all cookies”, you agree Stack Exchange can store cookies on your device and disclose information in accordance with our Cookie Policy.
