But that second class doesn't actually use at all; instead, it creates its own array, and calls a method which has a similar, but not identical, name as a method in .  One significant problem with is that it never creates an actual array -- its array member variable remains . You need a "" expression to create the actual array. Then your test class should be doing something like  In your StringArray.addStrinToArray() method, you attempt to assign a string to an element of a null array:  You need to initialise the array:  Where initialSize is an integer containing the initial size of the array.  8,78677 gold badges4646 silver badges6969 bronze badges  2  this is what i gotrun: Exception in thread "main" java.lang.UnsupportedOperationException: Not yet implemented contents of testArray at ooplab3.testStringarray.addString(testStringarray.java:32) at ooplab3.testStringarray.main(testStringarray.java:23) Java Result: 1 BUILD SUCCESSFUL (total time: 0 seconds)  By clicking “Accept all cookies”, you agree Stack Exchange can store cookies on your device and disclose information in accordance with our Cookie Policy.
