I'm told to 'allocate from the heap a hash table with htsize buckets, each initially empty.' I've already made htsize specifiable via command line arguments and made it a global variable in the following code:  but I am not sure what 'allocating from the heap' entails. Can someone help break this down for me?  C has no standard hash table. You should have either gotten a library to work with, or the assignment is to write one yourself. Either way, the question is completely unclear as it stands.  @MicroVirus I do have to create one myself, I just need clarification on what the directions mean by 'allocating from the heap'  allocating from the heap means dynamic allocation. You will have to use malloc to achieve this. Do you know the concept of a hash table?  1 Answer 1  C does not provides standard data type hash table, you would have to implement one. Plus avoid using because it is a very 'unsafe' function and it's use is typically avoided.  By clicking “Accept all cookies”, you agree Stack Exchange can store cookies on your device and disclose information in accordance with our Cookie Policy.
