 set::begin() and set::end() in C++ STL  Sets are a type of associative containers in which each element has to be unique, because the value of the element identifies it. The value of the element cannot be modified once it is added to the set, though it is possible to remove and add the modified value of that element.  set::begin()  begin() function is used to return an iterator pointing to the first element of the set container. begin() function returns a bidirectional iterator to the first element of the container. Syntax :  Examples:  Errors and Exceptions 1. It has a no exception throw guarantee. 2. Shows error when a parameter is passed.  CPP  Output:  CPP  Output:  CPP  Output:  Time Complexity: O(1)  set::end()  It returns an iterator pointing to past the last element of the set container. Since it does not refer to a valid element, it cannot de-referenced end() function returns a bidirectional iterator. Syntax :  Examples:  Errors and Exceptions 1. It has a no exception throw guarantee. 2. Shows error when a parameter is passed.  Writing code in comment?
