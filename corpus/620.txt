In particular:  (1) what do things such as fa (heap left redzone) and fd (freed heap region) mean?  (2) What is the significance of the 00s and 05s.  (3) What is the significance of the memory block being pointed to (0x0c067fff8010)?  (4) What is a wild pointer?  (5) Why is the fa on the line with the memory block that has an arrow to it in square brackets ([fa])?  1 Answer 1  You left out a crucial bit of the output. Here is the legend (taken from the documentation):  After reading this description, I think the address to your questions is, in turn:  The redzone is a region of unaccessible data both to the left and to the right of an allocation. ASan keeps a bitmask of the entire memory and determines for each 8-byte region wat kind of memory it is.  As the legend shows, 00 is fully addressable memory, 01 through 07 means "partially addressable". A value with in it presumably means the first 5 bytes of that 8-byte block may be addressed.  is the index into the bitmap. The part in brackets indicates which shadow byte is intended. Multiply it by 8 and you get , which must presumably be still modified a bit to get back at the offending memory region.  A wild pointer is one that points into unallocated (or recently freed) memory.  By clicking “Accept all cookies”, you agree Stack Exchange can store cookies on your device and disclose information in accordance with our Cookie Policy.
