I've had to already fixed an issue where when using the data types provided by eigen within a STL, I get an align error  error C2719: '_Val': formal parameter with __declspec(align('16')) won't be aligned  So the code in question references my structure and a vector of my structure (with the eigen specially aligned fix):  Then my code fails after a when I try to create a new my_struct after a certain number of iterations (it can sometimes creates the new object, with no problems), other times it fails.  1 Answer 1  Without -DNDEBUG, you should have got an assert sending you to this page. In your case, you should follow this one. In short, add to your structure such that new my_struct call an aligned memory allocator.  By clicking “Accept all cookies”, you agree Stack Exchange can store cookies on your device and disclose information in accordance with our Cookie Policy.
