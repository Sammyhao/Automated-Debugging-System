Define a function sort list that takes in a list and returns a list sorted in ascending order. (4 marks) Note: your code should make use of the insert list function defined earlier. With my previous defined variables:  I did a trial  But i keep getting Runtime error where File "", line 7, in search return search(x, seq[:-1])  2 Answers 2  You are recursively calling the search() method and never breaking out of this loop. I expect this is raising a exception.  Python has a recursion limit to protect against infinite recursion. FYI you can modify the recursion limit via - but this is not something you should be doing.  Instead you can fix this by re-writing your algorithm iteratively.  I also suggest you read the Python sorting wiki, as this demonstrates the pythonic way to sort things with the built in function and the list method . You don't need to re-invent the wheel.  By clicking “Accept all cookies”, you agree Stack Exchange can store cookies on your device and disclose information in accordance with our Cookie Policy.
