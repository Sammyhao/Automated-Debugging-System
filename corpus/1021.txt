 Program for nth Catalan Number  Catalan numbers are a sequence of natural numbers that occurs in many interesting counting problems like following.  Count the number of expressions containing n pairs of parentheses which are correctly matched. For n = 3, possible expressions are ((())), ()(()), ()()(), (())(), (()()).  Count the number of possible Binary Search Trees with n keys (See this)  Count the number of full binary trees (A rooted binary tree is full if every vertex has either two children or no children) with n+1 leaves.  Given a number n, return the number of ways you can draw n chords in a circle with 2 x n points such that no 2 chords intersect.  See this for more applications. The first few Catalan numbers for n = 0, 1, 2, 3, … are 1, 1, 2, 5, 14, 42, 132, 429, 1430, 4862, …  C++  Java  Python  C#  PHP  Javascript  Output  Time complexity of above implementation is equivalent to nth catalan number.  The value of nth catalan number is exponential that makes the time complexity exponential.  Dynamic Programming Solution : We can observe that the above recursive implementation does a lot of repeated work (we can the same by drawing recursion tree). Since there are overlapping subproblems, we can use dynamic programming for this. Following is a Dynamic programming based implementation .  C++  Java  Python3  C#  PHP  Javascript  Output  Time Complexity: Time complexity of above implementation is O(n2)  Using Binomial Coefficient We can also use the below formula to find nth Catalan number in O(n) time.  C++  Java  Python3  C#  PHP  Javascript  Output  Time Complexity: Time complexity of above implementation is O(n). We can also use below formula to find nth catalan number in O(n) time.  Use multi-precision library: In this method, we have used boost multi-precision library, and the motive behind its use is just only to have precision meanwhile finding the large CATALAN’s number and a generalized technique using for loop to calculate Catalan numbers .  For example: N = 5  Initially set cat_=1 then, print cat_ ,  then, iterate from i = 1 to i < 5  for i = 1; cat_ = cat_ * (4*1-2)=1*2=2 cat_ = cat_ / (i+1)=2/2 = 1  For i = 2; cat_ = cat_ * (4*2-2)=1*6=6 cat_ = cat_ / (i+1)=6/3=2  For i = 3 :- cat_ = cat_ * (4*3-2)=2*10=20 cat_ = cat_ / (i+1)=20/4=5  For i = 4 :- cat_ = cat_ * (4*4-2)=5*14=70 cat_ = cat_ / (i+1)=70/5=14  C++  Java  Python3  C#  Javascript  Output  Time Complexity: O(n) Auxiliary Space: O(1)  Another solution using BigInteger in java:  Finding values of catalan numbers for N>80 is not possible even by using long in java, so we use BigInteger  Here we find solution using Binomial Coefficient method as discussed above  Java  Output  References: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalan_number Please write comments if you find anything incorrect, or you want to share more information about the topic discussed above  Writing code in comment?
