 Which C++ libraries are useful for competitive programming?  C++ is one of the most recommended languages in competitive programming (please refer our previous article for the reason)  C++ STL contains lots of containers which are useful for different purposes. In this article, we are going to focus on the most important containers from competitive programming and interview preparation point of view.  vector : (#include<vector>) Dynamic Sized Array that allows insertions and deletions without caring of size of the array. It also has advantages of plain arrays like random access and cache friendliness. C++ vector supports many additional operations like erase(), push_front(), insert(), etc.  deque : (#include<deque> Dequeue supports insertions and deletions at both ends in O(1) time. Since it is implemented using array, it allows random access also. We can use dequeue to implement Queue and Stack both. Example problems on Deque are, visit all petrol pumps and maximums of all subarrays of size k.  We will be covering more important C++ libraries in next part of this article.  Writing code in comment?
