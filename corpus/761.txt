The problem, however, is that because of recursion the value of is reset to 0. I also tried making static but it complicates the problem even more and doesn't solve it either.  here is the link to code github.com/fsl4faisal/skeleton-sp16/blob/master/lab8/lab8/… -- I have changed the code at line 150 to-- keys=(K[])new Comparable[size]; and it seem to have suppressed the error but iterator is still not working, I am using the counter variable in inOrder() fn to save the items in the array, but the code is still buggy.  1 Answer 1  Instead of using an Array I used an ArrayList and it solved the problem. The problem with the previous code was that the used to reset to 0 during the recursive call to since it was a local variable. Changing it to array list eliminated the counter variable with function and it solved the problem Below is the code for the same:-  By clicking “Accept all cookies”, you agree Stack Exchange can store cookies on your device and disclose information in accordance with our Cookie Policy.
