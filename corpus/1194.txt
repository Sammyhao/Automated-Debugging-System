With a debugger you can step through your code statement by statement (and step into your function calls), while monitoring variables and their values.  You tagged the question with C++ but your code looks like C with iostream. Is there a reason you didn't use STL?  1 Answer 1  You are calculating the left and right of a heap element as-  Assume that is . In that case, it will give as which is incorrect.
