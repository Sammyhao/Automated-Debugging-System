A priority queue stores a "sorted" list of items (in your case Integers).  When you add an int to pQueue ,it is places the value in the correct position.  E.g if I add numbers 1, 10 and 5 in this order to a priority Queue, something like this will happen:  notice how 5 gets placed between 1 and 10.  When you call the first element of pQueue is returned which is guaranteed to be the smallest value inside the queue. (The value is removed from the queue during this process).  Repeated calls would return the numbers in the example above in the order 1 , 5, 10.  An unbounded priority queue based on a priority heap. The elements of the priority queue are ordered according to their natural ordering, or by a Comparator provided at queue construction time, depending on which constructor is used.  As you are using Integers, which have natural ordering defined, it works out of the box.  By clicking “Accept all cookies”, you agree Stack Exchange can store cookies on your device and disclose information in accordance with our Cookie Policy.
