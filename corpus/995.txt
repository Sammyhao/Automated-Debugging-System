For Linked List 1->2->3->4->5, fun1() prints 5->4->3->2->1.  2. What does the following function do for a given Linked List?  C++  C  Java  Python3  C#  Javascript  fun2() prints alternate nodes of the given Linked List, first from head to end, and then from end to head. If Linked List has even number of nodes, then fun2() skips the last node. For Linked List 1->2->3->4->5, fun2() prints 1 3 5 5 3 1. For Linked List 1->2->3->4->5->6, fun2() prints 1 3 5 5 3 1.  Below is a complete running program to test the above functions.  C++  C  Java  Python3  C#  Javascript  Output:  Please write comments if you find any of the answers/explanations incorrect, or you want to share more information about the topics discussed above.  Writing code in comment?
