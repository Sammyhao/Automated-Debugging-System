 Graph implementation using STL for competitive programming | Set 2 (Weighted graph)  In Set 1, unweighted graph is discussed. In this post, weighted graph representation using STL is discussed. The implementation is for adjacency list representation of weighted graph.  Undirected Weighted Graph  We use two STL containers to represent graph:  vector : A sequence container. Here we use it to store adjacency lists of all vertices. We use vertex number as index in this vector.  pair : A simple container to store pair of elements. Here we use it to store adjacent vertex number and weight of edge connecting to the adjacent.  The idea is to use a vector of pair vectors. Below code implements the same.  C++  Python3  Javascript  Output:  This article is contributed by Sahil Chhabra (akku). and improved by Kunal Verma If you like GeeksforGeeks and would like to contribute, you can also write an article using write.geeksforgeeks.org or mail your article to review-team@geeksforgeeks.org.
