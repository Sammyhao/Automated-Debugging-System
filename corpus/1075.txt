 Recursively Reversing a linked list (A simple implementation)  Given pointer to the head node of a linked list, the task is to recursively reverse the linked list. We need to reverse the list by changing links between nodes.  In this approach of reversing a linked list by passing a single pointer what we are trying to do is that we are making the previous node of the current node as his next node to reverse the linked list.  We return the pointer of next node to his previous(current) node and then make the previous node as the next node of returned node and then returning the current node.  We first traverse till the last node and making the last node as the head node of reversed linked list and then applying the above procedure in the recursive manner.  Writing code in comment?
