 std::string::data() in C++  Last Updated : 06 Jul, 2017  The data() function writes the characters of the string into an array. It returns a pointer to the array, obtained from conversion of string to the array. Its Return type is not a valid C-string as no ‘\0’ character gets appended at the end of array. Syntax:  std::string::data() returns an array that is owned by the string. Thus, the caller must not modify or free the memory. Let’s take same example where ptr points to final array.  Return value of data() is valid only until the next call of a non-constant member function for the same string. Explanation : Suppose, str be the original string which is required to be converted in an array  Output:  Here, we can easily notice, both contents and length of original string and transformed array are same.
