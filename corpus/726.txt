 How to use map and filter simultaneously on an array using JavaScript ?  Given an array and the task is to use filter and map function simultaneously to the given array. First lets look at map and filter functions in brief:  filter() method: This method returns a new array containing the elements that passes a certain test performed on an original array.  Syntax:  Used Parameters and variables:  newArray: The array that is returned.  oldArray: The filter function runs onto every element of this array.  currentValue: The current element’s value.  index: The current element’s array index..  array: The array object to which the current element belongs to.  map() method: This method is used to apply a function on every element in an array and returns a new array of same size as the input array.  Syntax:  Used Parameters and variables:  newArray: The array that is to be returned.  oldArray: The map function runs onto every element of this array.  currentValue: The current element’s value.  index: The current element’s array index.  array: The array object to which the current element belongs to.  Approach: Firstly, by using filter() function we will retrieve those elements from an array that satisfies the given condition. As the filter() method will return the array with the required elements.
