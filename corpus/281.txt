 C++ Program For Searching An Element In A Linked List  Last Updated : 27 Dec, 2021  Write a function that searches a given key ‘x’ in a given singly linked list. The function should return true if x is present in linked list and false otherwise.  For example, if the key to be searched is 15 and linked list is 14->21->11->30->10, then function should return false. If key to be searched is 14, then the function should return true. Iterative Solution:  Following is iterative implementation of above algorithm to search a given key.  C++  Output:  Recursive Solution:  Following is the recursive implementation of the above algorithm to search a given key.  Writing code in comment?
