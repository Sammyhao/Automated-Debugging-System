I could not find a way to call a proper overload  1 Answer 1  PowerShell allows for much more type coercion than C# does. For instance, PowerShell will coerce a DateTime to string if that is required (or an int to a bool or a string to a bool). I suspect that the overload resolution is finding a direct type match on the first parameter and then noting the second parameter can be coerced and none of the overloads exactly match types. That said, I happen to agree with you. I would like to see PowerShell get even better with its member overload resolution. In this case, I would say that type compatibility should take precedence over type coercion. Of course, putting a bool in an object reference requires boxing so perhaps that knocked down the scoring for that particular overload.  By clicking “Accept all cookies”, you agree Stack Exchange can store cookies on your device and disclose information in accordance with our Cookie Policy.
