I solved the problem using the Dijkstra Algorithm and adjacency list graph. When I have tested the input example, my program works fine, but I don't know what to do to skip this Runtime error! My code below  -------------------------------EDIT----------------------------- I have made things in the code to avoid the Runtime Error. First I corrected my mistakes of memory leak (Thanks us2012 and NPE!) then I treated cases of disconnected graphs. This is the version of the code that was accepted by the judge.  1 Answer 1  The destructor is called automatically when you it, so essentially you're calling it twice. This is how you find out about that when you don't know it: (relevant lines marked as )  15.7k22 gold badges4343 silver badges6262 bronze badges  1  Thanks! I was explicitly calling the destructor, I think it is not a good idea. I have made some changes in the code, I used delete instead of ~Destructor() and then I avoided the leak of memory.  By clicking “Accept all cookies”, you agree Stack Exchange can store cookies on your device and disclose information in accordance with our Cookie Policy.
