When I run it in the terminal, it says a warning message, not an error, but still doesn't display any results. I am working on a dfsrecursive, BFS, bfs helper, and DFS function. Please help!  "When I run it in the terminal, it says a warning message" I guess you mean when you compile. What warning, anyway?  -- This is not valid C++. Arrays in C++ must have their sizes denoted by a constant expression, not a runtime variable. Second, even if this were legal C++, you are creating an array with maximum size of 0 elements.  I got it to work more but my bfs function is only printing out zeros. I initialized size, begin, adjMatrix, noOfNodes to zero, which one of these should I not initialize to zero?  I do not see a recursive call in you method. Also I am not sure why you are using two for loop, IMO first is not needed  By clicking “Accept all cookies”, you agree Stack Exchange can store cookies on your device and disclose information in accordance with our Cookie Policy.
