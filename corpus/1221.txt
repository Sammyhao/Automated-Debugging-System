If there was such a compiler bug in a small toy program as you've demonstrated, then most of the C++ community would have talked about it and informed the compiler writers (and would be embarrassing for the folks who maintain the compiler). Thus it is always unlikely it is a compiler bug.  1 Answer 1  You're using in the function call but points to an internal buffer inside the that has already been destroyed because it was a temporary, attempting to read from it is undefined behavior and thus the only bug here is your code.  By clicking “Accept all cookies”, you agree Stack Exchange can store cookies on your device and disclose information in accordance with our Cookie Policy.
