What am I doing wrong ?  You ought to use a custom compare function that acts reasonably. The most important should be that A<A returns false (in your code it is typically true). But also when A<B is true you should not have B<A also true, which will occur in many cases in your code. But I don't know the internals of sort well enough to predict how it would malfunction will an unstable comparison function. So I'm not sure this is your major problem  After finding num1 and num2 are equal up to the length of the shorter one, your code appears to compare the rest (if any) of num1 to the earlier part of itself (not to any part of num2). Was that really your intent?  1 Answer 1  All elements in your end up having the same value converted into string:  And, in your function, you are not checking if the numbers are equal. Add that as well at the top of the function:  10.1k66 gold badges3131 silver badges5959 bronze badges  1  1  That check at the top whether the strings are equal would just waste time and cover up part of a more fundamental problem. The overall comparison should avoid all cases where both A<B is true and B<A is true. In the course of making such a correction, you would get A<A false without needing an extra test for ==  By clicking “Accept all cookies”, you agree Stack Exchange can store cookies on your device and disclose information in accordance with our Cookie Policy.
