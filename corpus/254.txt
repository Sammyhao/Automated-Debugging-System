There are many answers to what you have here... Are you trying to collect a list of users? Why a String[]?  Do you want to copy each property into the string array ? What do you mean when you say "where all objects inside of this class should be converted into an String[]" you only have ints and strings within the class, doesnt make sense to convert them to a string[], but you might want to copy to string[].  Im going to put the array into a session variable and cast it to an array again in the other page. I chose to use an array because the DisplayedData class is not accessible in the other page.  By clicking “Accept all cookies”, you agree Stack Exchange can store cookies on your device and disclose information in accordance with our Cookie Policy.
