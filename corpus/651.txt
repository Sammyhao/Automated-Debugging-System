And I hope the data structure provides following methods,  Is it possbile to implement some data structure like this? I know hashtable could support the first method and heap could support the second and third method, but I do not know how to mix them together. Any ideas?  Note that a heap does not support your third method, insert in a heap is O(log n).  1 Answer 1  There is a very simple data structure that meets your stated requirements.  Use a hash table (keyed on the first col) and in addition store a pointer to your minimum element (by the third col). Then, is a hashtable lookup, is a pointer dereference, and is a hashtable insert and a comparison to determine if the min pointer needs to be updated.  Note that this gives O(n) deletion (of the minimum), but you didn't state any requirements on deletion.  actually, I need the delete operation, the more precise description of the 'get_min_by_third_col' should be pop_min_by_third_col  By clicking “Accept all cookies”, you agree Stack Exchange can store cookies on your device and disclose information in accordance with our Cookie Policy.
