This way there will be something in the queue while you debug. Then when finished use to restore activation.  This does not work if the error only occurs when service broker runs it. I am having an issue right now where running the proc by itself works but fails when SB runs it. Seems like SB is killing the connection during a web request.  Good point but this should be a separate question. I would check the user permissions first, there is an EXECUTE AS clause for SB activation. Have fun :)  Thanks, my issue turned out to be caused by max text size being set at 4K. I solved it with set sextsize -1. Took me 2 days.  I know this is old but maybe someone else has this problem.  You can use SQL Profiler to catch the line number and proc where an error is happening. If you use Print statements then they will show up in the profiler.  By clicking “Accept all cookies”, you agree Stack Exchange can store cookies on your device and disclose information in accordance with our Cookie Policy.
