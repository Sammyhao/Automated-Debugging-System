Geek is interested to find the total number of pairs (i,j) such that x <= a[i]*a[j] <= y (1<=i<j<=n). Help the geek to find total number of such pairs.  Example 1:  Example 2:  Constraints:  Here is my code:  Output after submission: Runtime Error: Runtime ErrorTime Limit Exceeded  Your program took more time than expected. Expected Time Limit 7.60sec Hint : Please optimize your code and submit again.  That's the whole point of this exercise - to write code using more efficient algorithm  Try searching on GeeksforGeeks for the same question. There might be an article explaining how to optimize it.  Not really. The complexity of combinations itself here would be N choose 2, so it's still an N^2 solution.  Here's what I think you can do, without trying to give away much of the code since it's an exercise after all.  Essentially, for each number in the array, you need to find how many numbers exist in the array which are in the range .  Take an example, if x = 7 and y = 19, and say num = 2. Then the minimum product that will satisfy the conditions is 8, which is The maximum product likewise is 18, which is . So for 2, you need numbers in the list that lie in the range [4, 9].  Does that give you a hint on what you're supposed to do?  You sort the array first. Then for each num: 1)You find the index of ceil(x/num) and floor(y/num), using binary search 2)The number of pairs would be the difference of the two indices + 1.  The complexity for this would be, well you take O(NlogN) time to sort, and then you run through all the numbers which takes O(N) time, for each number you perform two binary search operations, so that's  By clicking “Accept all cookies”, you agree Stack Exchange can store cookies on your device and disclose information in accordance with our Cookie Policy.
