How can i do it with mapreduce?  89133 gold badges1212 silver badges1616 bronze badges  4  So, what do you want to sort by? key or value? Can you provide an example showing the file and how it should be sorted?  1 Answer 1  You can probably do this (I'm assuming you are using Java here)  From maps emit like this -  So, all you values that needs to be sorted should be the key in your mapreduce job. Hadoop by default sorts by ascending order of key.  Hence, either you do this to sort in descending order,  Or, this,  You need to set a custom Descending Sort Comparator, which goes something like this in your job.  The suffle and sort phase in Hadoop will take care of sorting your keys in descending order 24,4,12,23  After comment:  If you require a Descending IntWritable Comparable, you can create one and use it like this -  4,94311 gold badge2020 silver badges4040 bronze badges  11  If i have 5 computers running the code, does this code work and the final result is absoulutly true? how many reducer do i need?  Yes, you can have any number of reducrs. I'm also assuming you know how to write a MapReduce job. Please give it a shot and tell me if it solves your issue. I think it will with repect to the use case you have mentioned. Thank you.  Trying to use this DescendingIntWritableComparable to implement a descending sort instead of ascending sort, but job.setSortComparatorClass() does not see DescendingIntComparable.class as a class that extends RawComparator, so it doesn't run. Any ideas how to modify this so it'll work?  By clicking “Accept all cookies”, you agree Stack Exchange can store cookies on your device and disclose information in accordance with our Cookie Policy.
