 C program to implement Adjacency Matrix of a given Graph  Given a undirected Graph of N vertices 1 to N and M edges in form of 2D array arr[][] whose every row consists of two numbers X and Y which denotes that there is a edge between X and Y, the task is to write C program to create Adjacency Matrix of the given Graph.  Approach: The idea is to use a square Matrix of size NxN to create Adjacency Matrix. Below are the steps:  Create a 2D array(say Adj[N+1][N+1]) of size NxN and initialise all value of this matrix to zero.  For each edge in arr[][](say X and Y), Update value at Adj[X][Y] and Adj[Y][X] to 1, denotes that there is a edge between X and Y.  Display the Adjacency Matrix after the above operation for all the pairs in arr[][].  Below is the implementation of the above approach:  Output:  Time Complexity: O(N2), where N is the number of vertices in a graph.  Writing code in comment?
