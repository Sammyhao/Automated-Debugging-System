Just store the numbers in an array and reverse slices of the array. you even store the data in array, reverse it, and then go back into linked list. And why ? Why not ? Please post MCVE, how is declared? How is the function called? You don't read any input and don't output anything from the code? Please post a full reproducible example that's compilable. .  The TLE means that, sadly, the solution isn't good enough. Quite often with "online judge" problems, the obvious solution won't be quick enough, and the real problem is to find a good algorithm and to code it efficiently.  Post as a guest  Not the answer you're looking for?
