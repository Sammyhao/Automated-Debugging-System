Is topological sort is always DFS in reverse order? If not is there a counter example?  If you see my output for the particular graph the DFS output and its reverse is a correct solution for topological sort of the graph too....also reading the CLR topological sort alorithm it also looks like topological sort is the reverse of DFS?  By clicking “Accept all cookies”, you agree Stack Exchange can store cookies on your device and disclose information in accordance with our Cookie Policy.
