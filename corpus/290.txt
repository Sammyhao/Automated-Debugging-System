I'm not sure what the flags used on GCC are on ideone, but if it's not using optimization, it's conceivable that unwinding the STL's template mess would be heavy,  1 Answer 1  So, if the question is to find an online IDE that will run this code, try looking at Online GDB. Seems to be running it fine:  7,2851010 gold badges5757 silver badges123123 bronze badges  1  a local host would work fine, since there would be no time limit there. Seems like either doesn't have any time limit or the time limit is more generous.  By clicking “Accept all cookies”, you agree Stack Exchange can store cookies on your device and disclose information in accordance with our Cookie Policy.
