 Implementation of BFS using adjacency matrix  Breadth First Search (BFS) has been discussed in this article which uses adjacency list for the graph representation. In this article, adjacency matrix will be used to represent the graph.  Adjacency matrix representation: In adjacency matrix representation of a graph, the matrix mat[][] of size n*n (where n is the number of vertices) will represent the edges of the graph where mat[i][j] = 1 represents that there is an edge between the vertices i and j while mat[i][j] = 0 represents that there is no edge between the vertices i and j.  Below is the adjacency matrix representation of the graph shown in the above image:  Create a matrix of size n*n where every element is 0 representing there is no edge in the graph.  Now, for every edge of the graph between the vertices i and j set mat[i][j] = 1.  After the adjacency matrix has been created and filled, find the BFS traversal of the graph as described in this post.  Below is the implementation of the above approach:  Writing code in comment?
