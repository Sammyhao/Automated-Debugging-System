 Array of Linked Lists in C/C++  An array in C/C++ or be it in any programming language is a collection of similar data items stored at contiguous memory locations and elements can be accessed randomly using indices of an array. They can be used to store the collection of primitive data types such as int, float, double, char, etc of any particular type. To add to it, an array in C/C++ can store derived data types such as structures, pointers, etc. Given below is the picture representation of an array.  A linked list is a linear data structure consisting of nodes where each node contains a reference to the next node. To create a link list we need a pointer that points to the first node of the list.  Approach: To create an array of linked lists below are the main requirements:  For keeping the track of the above-created array of pointers then another pointer is needed that points to the first pointer of the array. This pointer is called pointer to pointer.  Below is the pictorial representation of the array of linked lists:  Below is the C++ program to implement the array of linked list:  Writing code in comment?
