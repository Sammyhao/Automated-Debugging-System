To clarify what I want to do, this is the C# code:  Also, even without knowing what a is, you probably don't want to be calling twice per iteration. More related: I'd imagine that is returning an iterator into either a full entry set, or just the value list (since it is obviously not returning a direct iterator for the key set); so you'll need to check the documentation / methods of and use the correct methods appropriately (whatever they are).  //BinarySearchDictionary is my class name // from a class that implements the Comparable interface. public class BinarySearchTreeDictionary<K extends Comparable<K>,V> implements Iterable<BinarySearchTreeDictionary.BSTNode<K, V>> {  Although I haven't used this in a while, there's probably a cleaner way of doing this  What you want to use is the HashMap or the TreeMap to implement a dictionary in Java. The HashMap class uses hashing to maintain the dictionary while TreeMap uses a Red Black Tree(a variant of the BST) to maintain the dictionary.  Moreover, if the mapping is from a String to a class Label, then can use the following code. You will also have to import java.util.* and declare the Label class separately for the code to run successfully.  By clicking “Accept all cookies”, you agree Stack Exchange can store cookies on your device and disclose information in accordance with our Cookie Policy.
