I've tried but still cant get it to work  Hi there, so are you suggesting to use lower_bound() or upper_bound() to implement a binary search? Able to give an example of how to implement it? Why is find() more efficient? i thought it does a linear search? so it is basically O(n) where as binary search is probably O(log n)  @dupdupdup is normally implemented using a binary tree. (the member function, not the standard algorithm) performs a binary search to find the key.  @dupdupdup : The pages I linked to specifically state the complexity requirements. "Complexity: Logarithmic in the size of the container."  @dupdupdup A bit of advise. If your look ups and insertions are not mixed, Scott Meyers recommends using sorted vector instead of map in Effective STL 'Item 23: Consider replacing associative containers with sorted vectors'.

Using container member functions, where they are present, is preferable to algorithms.  @user2134488 yes, that's how templates work - unless specialized for a type, an STL container functions independent of the type  binary_serach requires iterator. and are not iterators. Another problem is that accessing is very likely to crash your application.  By clicking “Accept all cookies”, you agree Stack Exchange can store cookies on your device and disclose information in accordance with our Cookie Policy.
