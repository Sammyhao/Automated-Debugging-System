 Time complexities of different data structures  Time Complexity is a concept in computer science that deals with the quantification of the amount of time taken by a set of code or algorithm to process or run as a function of the amount of input. In other words, the time complexity is how long a program takes to process a given input. The efficiency of an algorithm depends on two parameters:  Time Complexity  Space Complexity  Time Complexity: It is defined as the number of times a particular instruction set is executed rather than the total time is taken. It is because the total time took also depends on some external factors like the compiler used, processorâ€™s speed, etc.  Space Complexity: It is the total memory space required by the program for its execution.  Average time complexity of different data structures for different operations  Worst Case time complexity of different data structures for different operations  Writing code in comment?
