None of the other code appears to contribute to your BST to linked list logic, so it just clutters everything up. It'll also help a bit if everything is indented neatly.  1 Answer 1  The basic key as to why the code is wrong is this line: and in the method  You are assuming that when you set a parameter to a new node it is propagated up the call stack (call by reference).
