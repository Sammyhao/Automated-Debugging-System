System.Net.Http.Formatting: No MediaTypeFormatter is available to read an object of type 'Object' from content with media type 'application/octet-stream'.  can you tell me what i forgot bold line is giving problem in post request, i tried with contentType and without ContentType; with body and without body.  How can i parse Json object in request body in azure function. one way i could was to parse it in string then deserialized using jsonconvert. is their any better way of doing it like valueproviders modelbinders etc.  that worked for me, is there a way that i can parse my json into class, i tried to parse it in string and then deserialize using jsonconvert.deserialize<T> can it be done automatically.  As Connor said as long as the header is set to in your request this code will work fine. An issue I have run into though is that the add header functionality when testing azure functions in azure portal doesn't seem to work in this case.  If you can send a request to your function from outside of the test section of azure functions this should work fine.  By clicking “Accept all cookies”, you agree Stack Exchange can store cookies on your device and disclose information in accordance with our Cookie Policy.
