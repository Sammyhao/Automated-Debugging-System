C language.  My algorithm is this: 1) find max value in list 2) remove it from the list and insert it at Head node 3) start algorithm again from next node 4) run until you reach end of list  I have something, but it doesn't 'remember' my list. I realize I'm making a mistake somewhere (probably recursive calls), but I can't understand how to fix it.  67411 gold badge66 silver badges1818 bronze badges  4  The function modifies (indirectly) but you don't emulate "pass by reference". I assume you do it because the function returns a , but the problem is that will always return . Use a debugger, and step through the code line by line.  @Someprogrammerdude I was also experimenting with this signature but didn't get any better results, only different type of wrong behavior. Can you explain further please? Or provide an example?  You have three return statements in . One is and the two others are both How can it ever return a non-NULL?  My plan was that line executes only when sorting is finished, however I admit to not being very good with recursion techniques. Can you provide an example of working code please?  1 Answer 1  38.7k66 gold badges3030 silver badges6969 bronze badges  2  Works like a charm! Thanks a lot! I guess what confused me was this last part, and returning node...
