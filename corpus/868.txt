 Juggler Sequence | Set 2 (Using Recursion)  Last Updated : 07 Dec, 2021  Juggler Sequence is a series of integer number in which the first term starts with a positive integer number a and the remaining terms are generated from the immediate previous term using the below recurrence relation :  Juggler Sequence starting with number 3: 5, 11, 36, 6, 2, 1 Juggler Sequence starting with number 9: 9, 27, 140, 11, 36, 6, 2, 1  Given a number N, we have to print the Juggler Sequence for this number as the first term of the sequence.  Examples:  Input: N = 9 Output: 9, 27, 140, 11, 36, 6, 2, 1 We start with 9 and use above formula to get next terms.  Iterative approach: We have already seen the iterative approach in Set 1 of this problem.  Recursive approach: In this approach, we will recursively traverse starting from N. Follow the steps below for each recursive step  Output the value of N  If N has reached 1 end the recursion  Otherwise, follow the formula based on the number being odd or even and call the recursive function on the newly derived number.  Writing code in comment?
