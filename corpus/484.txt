 Print all paths from a given source to a destination  Given a directed graph, a source vertex ‘s’ and a destination vertex ‘d’, print all paths from given ‘s’ to ‘d’. Consider the following directed graph. Let the s be 2 and d be 3. There are 3 different paths from 2 to 3.  Keep storing the visited vertices in an array or HashMap say ‘path[]’.  If the destination vertex is reached, print contents of path[].  The important thing is to mark current vertices in the path[] as visited also so that the traversal doesn’t go in a cycle.  Following is implementation of above idea.  C++14  Java  Python  C#  Javascript  Output:  Complexity Analysis:  Time Complexity: O(V^V). The time complexity is polynomial. From each vertex there are v vertices that can be visited from current vertex.  Auxiliary space: O(V^V). To store the paths V^V space is needed.  This article is contributed by Shivam Gupta.
