 8086 program to sort an integer array in ascending order  Problem – Write a program in 8086 microprocessor to sort numbers in ascending order in an array of n numbers, where size “n” is stored at memory address 2000 : 500 and the numbers are stored from memory address 2000 : 501.  Example –  Example explanation:  Algorithm –  Load data from offset 500 to register CL (for count).  Travel from starting memory location to last and compare two numbers if first number is greater than second number then swap them.  First pass fix the position for last number.  Decrease the count by 1.  Again travel from starting memory location to (last-1, by help of count) and compare two numbers if first number is greater than second number then swap them.  Second pass fix the position for last two numbers.  Repeated.  Program –  Explanation –  Writing code in comment?
