I am trying to create a binary search tree. The format of a node is a list of three elements, the first being the value at the node, the second being the left child node, and the third being the right child node. I have a "make" function, which creates an empty tree: ( () () () ). I also have the insert function. Here is the code:  To test it, I run the following lines:  I then receive the following error:  I have checked and re-checked my parentheses...and running it in debug mode, I see it fails at the END of inserting 2 into the tree. Until the, it works as planned. Is this the cause of a foolish syntax/logic error on my part?  1 Answer 1  The outer pair of parentheses is the problem here. gives you a list. By wrapping another pair of parentheses around it, you're trying to apply that list as if it was a function, which you can't - thus the error message.  350k5050 gold badges653653 silver badges663663 bronze badges  2  2  Thank you so much! I had a feeling it was a stupid mistake on my part. Worked like a charm. I guess the whole "When in doubt, add more parentheses" doesn't apply here.  @Ryan You know how Python is indentation-sensitive, and Ruby is whitespace-sensitive? Lisp and Scheme are parentheses-sensitive.  By clicking “Accept all cookies”, you agree Stack Exchange can store cookies on your device and disclose information in accordance with our Cookie Policy.
