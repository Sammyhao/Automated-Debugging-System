You should format your code, by the way. It's unreadable at the moment. Also, I see no actual implementation of a linked list - just a method... in a class called using . That's really horrible naming...  15.2k77 gold badges5454 silver badges8585 bronze badges  4  R u sure u run it successfully... it is throwing an exception while (litr.hasPrevious ()) { Object obj3=litr.next (); System.out.print (obj3+","); }; is wrong  @PramodKumar : yeah! I posted output with an exception. Well he has wrong code while printing list in reverse order. Let him figure it out.  Exception in thread "main" java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: Linkedlist/java Caused by: java.lang.ClassNotFoundException: Linkedlist.java at java.net.URLClassLoader$1.run(URLClassLoader.java:217) at java.security.AccessController.doPrivileged(Native Method) at java.net.URLClassLoader.findClass(URLClassLoader.java:205) at java.lang.ClassLoader.loadClass(ClassLoader.java:321) at sun.misc.Launcher$AppClassLoader.loadClass(Launcher.java:294) at java.lang.ClassLoader.loadClass(ClassLoader.java:266) Could not find the main class: Linkedlist.java. Program will exit.  The first answer (by Nandkumar) is right, I'd also check the runtime error, caused by this lines:  That is: you check if your iterator has a "previous" item, then go for tne "next"? Probably not what you intended to do.  The "error" at compile time is only a warning, you can run your program after compilation, but the compiler is telling you that it found something strange in your code.  2,88422 gold badges2626 silver badges4848 bronze badges  2  got dis exception java -classpath .
