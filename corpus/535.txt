Hence I figured I had to implement a custom sort using a closure. But I'm brand new at Groovy and been struggling to get this very simple task done!  This use natural ordering (or sorting) which is case sensitive. How can I make this case insensitive ?  m.sort { a, b -> a.value.toLowerCase() <=> b.value.toLowerCase() } is the correct answer for this other solution :)  If somebody is looking for how to make it work in the Jenkins pipeline script, you will have to create a separate method with annotation for that:  And then call it from the pipeline script.  You can of course apply "case sensitive" logic on top.  Confirmed, I've been fighting this in a Jenkins pipeline and your suggestion is working for me. Thank you.  Actually it would make sense to create a separete question for that, that would include Jenkins pipelein in the title. Then it will be easier to find. I also spend a lot of time looking for solution :)  I created a separate question for that : stackoverflow.com/questions/63121651/… I hope it will be easier to find. If somebody could upvode, I will be glad :)  BTW, here is code which is showing different sorting with and without toLowerCase():  By clicking “Accept all cookies”, you agree Stack Exchange can store cookies on your device and disclose information in accordance with our Cookie Policy.
