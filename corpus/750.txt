The hash table uses separate chaining method to handle collisions and thus requires linked list (the hash table is implemented as an array of linked lists). I keep getting that "Debug Assertion Failed" error and I can't seem to find the problem. I tried lots of things with my code, especially on the constructors and destructors and still no result. Here are all of my codes. Please help I am still a newbie in programming. I am using Microsoft Visual Studio 2010 Ultimate.  If this is Visual Studio you can go to the line that the assertion fails on then walk up the callstack to the exact line of your code that caused the assertion to fail.  By clicking “Accept all cookies”, you agree Stack Exchange can store cookies on your device and disclose information in accordance with our Cookie Policy.
