I am in a situation where I would like to iterate through each entry in a hash table and then call a function after all the items are done processing.  In the past I have done this with arrays using async.js which has worked great, but this does not appear to work with hash tables unfortunately.  How can I iterate through each entry in a hash table and call a specific function when the last entry has been processed?  78k9494 gold badges284284 silver badges462462 bronze badges  4  So I'm a little confused here. In JS, every object is a hashtable. Is there something you are specifically doing that prevents you from simply doing a loop?  Is it possible to know when all items have finished processing using a standard for loop?  So your challenge is that you are performing async processing for each hash table entry & you want to know when they are all done. Clearly, the answer below is the correct one then.  By clicking “Accept all cookies”, you agree Stack Exchange can store cookies on your device and disclose information in accordance with our Cookie Policy.
