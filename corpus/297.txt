(Boost has such a thing.)  1 Answer 1  3,32111 gold badge88 silver badges2222 bronze badges  8  Thanks so much! However, I also needed to implement the default constructor to be able to declare -- I implemented it setting it to NULL: and it works fine!  By clicking “Accept all cookies”, you agree Stack Exchange can store cookies on your device and disclose information in accordance with our Cookie Policy.
