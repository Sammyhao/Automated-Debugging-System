This isn't a compile-time, but a runtime problem. Your program compiles fine, but runs for a long time, and this depends on your input.  3 Answers 3  6,86122 gold badges2121 silver badges3636 bronze badges  6  thanks....but even after doing what u told i am not getting the required output. Though that time limit message has gone  @kabby Bear in mind that, with a normal 32 bit the largest factorial you can calculate is 12  @kabby Put a print statement just before the return to print both x and ans. That should give you enough to fix the issue. I'm betting you forget to initialise ans with 1.  It is because your fact function goes into infinite loop.  Assuming you are calculating factorial of a number x, this should be the correct fact function.  It is an infinite loop. This is the reason why you get an error as time limit exceeded. Replace the loop to an if condition:  By clicking “Accept all cookies”, you agree Stack Exchange can store cookies on your device and disclose information in accordance with our Cookie Policy.
