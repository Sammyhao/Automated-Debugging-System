Abort trap: 6". The test2 is creating an array of size 10000 (with ints from 0 to 10000 in random order) and using heapsort and MinHeap class to sort it in order.  100% heapsort is correctly implemented. I've gone through the logic of the main MinHeap functions (insert -> bubble_up , extract -> bubble_down) but can't find the bugs.  Have you stepped through the problematic code with a debugger to see where the program deviates from what you expect? This should help you solve the problem, and if not it will help you reduce the amount of code given to a palatable size.  1 Answer 1  It looks like the last run through when the parent is 9466 in the bubble_down function, the array is going out of bounds because the limit is 10,000 and you are trying to compare the right value as being (2 * parent) + 2 which gives you 18,934. I am not exactly sure what you are trying to accomplish, but I think that is where the bug lies.  By clicking “Accept all cookies”, you agree Stack Exchange can store cookies on your device and disclose information in accordance with our Cookie Policy.
