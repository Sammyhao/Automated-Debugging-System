And probably the output is wrong.  I used typedef:  and thanks to the input from one of the guys, I updated my function to look like this, but now visual studio is giving an error that says:  "Declaration is incompatible with void List::PrintListRecursively", so I wonder that the way I pass the parameter is just a slight different.  thank you in advance  I wrote the same function not recursively:  and this one works great. Could somebody help out with the recursion part and help me find out whats wrong. Don't be too mean.  What is the problem with the recursive example? Why is the output wrong? Could you post a small working example?  By clicking “Accept all cookies”, you agree Stack Exchange can store cookies on your device and disclose information in accordance with our Cookie Policy.
