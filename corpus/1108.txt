Since the indexes are based on zero an array of elements will have indexes from to (inclusive). You are possibly out of bounds at least once.  Also, learn to use a debugger, because if you run your program in a debugger it will stop at the location of the crash, letting you examine the function call stack as well as the values of relevant variables.  What's the input that causes the error? By inputting random values I got a division by 0 error in , at .  1 Answer 1  In you loop through ALL numbers in your array . But at startup, as it's global data, most of them will be 0, so that will result in a fatal divide by 0.  You have somewhere to keep track of the numer of primes that you've stored in your array and only test against the primes that you've stored there.  Supposing that it's homework and you're not allowed to use vectors, you could do it as follows:  Some remarks:  for the index, it's safer to use the unsigned type .  make sure that whenever you use an index, it remains within the bounds  as you work with positive numbers, it could make sense to use  By clicking “Accept all cookies”, you agree Stack Exchange can store cookies on your device and disclose information in accordance with our Cookie Policy.
