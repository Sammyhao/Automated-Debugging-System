I was was trying to run this code in Code::Blocks and Ideone and both gave me the same runtime error. I tried changing to and astonishingly enough, the code ran. I am also worried about the initialisation of , because it doesn't seem to store the value of in it. Or maybe the retains the value (Could it be that the statement does not allow cases?)  I think the issue lies with the initialization of poo[t]. t is non-const, and array declarations require a const value.  Are you feeding it text which is 100 characters long (or longer)? It will break in that case. You should use safer input code anyway.  and a 100 characters long text fits in 101 array (because you have to add the \0 terminator of the string).  This means that you are reading a string (a series of s) into an array of integers. This doesn't cause each integer to hold one character; instead, the bytes of the integers will be filled in using character values. Consequently, when you iterate over the elements of the array, you will not get back clean values like .  To fix this, change the declaration of so that it's a array:  There may be other issues here, but this is certainly an issue you'll need to fix.  is a variable length array, valid in C99.
