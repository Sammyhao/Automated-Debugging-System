Either for how to use either of the above correctly, or for another parser that gives me what I want?  4 Answers 4  I stumbled in here with the same problem and I found a simple solution. I'm posting a more clear answer just in case it helps someone else:  I already had this class available (it was a transient dependency of something else in our project). So be sure to check if it's already there first. You might get lucky, too.  Given your description, it sounds like your definition doesn't match up. It dounds like it should be something like:  This will give you a JSONObject that is much easier to use than parsing the string yourself, but you will still have to drill into it and manually build your map. Kind of a half and half solution.  No, the List<List<List<String>>> is just the sample data, I want to have a map that I can traverse for any JSON dictionary  I don't think you are going to be able to map this: "{\"cases\":[{\"documents\":[{\"files\":[{\"name\":\"a.pdf\"}]}]}]}" to a List<Map<String,Object>> structure without manual work because the structures simply don't match. I would still go with using the JSONObject approach then building your map manually.  I already do so in both PHP and Cocoa, so I'm a bit surprised by this prediction. I'm not looking for an Object-mapper, I'm looking for a mapper of a JSON represented dictionary to a Map-based dictionary.  The easiest thing might be just to do it yourself: use something like GSON or tapestry's JSONObject to construct a java representatin of your json, then just iterate through it and build whatever map structure you like.  By clicking “Accept all cookies”, you agree Stack Exchange can store cookies on your device and disclose information in accordance with our Cookie Policy.
