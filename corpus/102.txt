I want to know if bfs traversal is possible for multi-way trees, if so where can I find coding references for it?  3 Answers 3  if you clearly understand how works, it doesn't matter what kind of tree (or more specifically) you are dealing with, you can always find a way.  if you are really not clear with how to do BFS in multy-nodes tree, here is my pseudocode for you:  Indeed, I searched too, and bfs aren't focus in multi-way trees. But, references on bfs with graph exists. Because multi-way trees are a subset of graphs, you may find your happiness there.  BFS is indeed a traversal that is not specific for binary trees, but can be used on any graph. Wikipedia has an entry on Breadth-first search, and it even offers pseudo code that is intended to work with any graph.  Input: A graph G and a starting vertex root of G  Output: Goal state.
