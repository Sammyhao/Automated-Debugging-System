The book does not provide the correct way to implement the iterator  3,36066 gold badges4848 silver badges9292 bronze badges  3  @Mat if node is the last node, then node->next is trailer, which means hasNext() is false  @Mat interesting, if I remove this if statement, then it's correct. Can you explain?  the print function is wrong, for the last item i = i.next has no next. the iterator is correct  1 Answer 1  your hasNext() function is correct for a doubly linked list, providing that trailer's next is NULL. the error is the usage in the print function  EDIT: the above code only do debugging for you. it's not how you implement the 'iterator'  firstly, change the next() implementation:  now, instead of returning the first element, return the header for iteration  now you can use the syntax similar to the book and STL:  Notice that since you return the header, you dont have to check if(size() > 0)  EDIT 2: in next(), you can advance the node of iterator instead of iterator container itself  By clicking “Accept all cookies”, you agree Stack Exchange can store cookies on your device and disclose information in accordance with our Cookie Policy.
