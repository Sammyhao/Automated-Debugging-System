 Print all nodes at distance K from given node: Iterative Approach  Given a binary tree, a target node and an integer K, the task is to find all the nodes that are at distance K from the given target node.  Consider the above-given Tree, For the target node 12. Input: K = 1 Output: 8 10 14  Approach: There are generally two cases for the nodes at a distance of K:  Node at a distance K is a child node of the target node.  Node at a distance K is the ancestor of the target node.  The idea is to store the parent node of every node in a hash-map with the help of the Level-order traversal on the tree. Then, Simply Traverse the nodes from the Target node using Breadth-First Search on the left-child, right-child, and the parent node. At any instant when the distance of a node the from the target node is equal to K then print all the nodes of the queue.  Below is the implementation of the above approach:  Writing code in comment?
