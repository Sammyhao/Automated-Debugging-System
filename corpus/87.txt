I use it to solve the pecman problem and other test. But when i meet the problem of repeated node, it can't be solved. I think the outcome should be A-C-D-F-G. More over, I think the main problem is that I use dictionary as the method of storing the route. However, I don't know why the dictionary can't solve the repeated node problem.  I'm sorry to do that. But it doesn't like code. So i don't find a way to attach it directly.  1 Answer 1  You can't have a for the whole search, back tracking means you need to have a per node pop'ed off the , so push the onto the Queue, e.g.:  Note: you don't need the clause as you from the clause. Note: sometimes it is cleaner to on a loop than a large indented block Note: a list of output nodes is sufficient without using a dictionary and much easier to manage Note: is a much better data structure for  27.5k33 gold badges4444 silver badges6767 bronze badges  2  I really appreciate the solution you wrote. I just use your solution to fix my code. Although it also has some mistakes, I try my best to understand your code and fix these mistakes. I think i could fix it tomorrow. I live in HongKong. Now it is 1:00 am. So i should go to sleep because i have a class tomorrow morning. I'm really happy you could help me solve this problem. Thanks you.  Good, I don't have the data or the classes you reference to be able to test myself so hard for me to spot any mistakes but hopefully this gives you the general ideas to solve the problem yourself.  By clicking “Accept all cookies”, you agree Stack Exchange can store cookies on your device and disclose information in accordance with our Cookie Policy.
