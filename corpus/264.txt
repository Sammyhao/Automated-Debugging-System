But you don't pass an argument.  It seems to me that your main problem is that you don't know what you're really supposed to do. You seem to have the actual inorder traversal working, all you need is to pass a pointer to a function that does something with the node data. But if you don't know what you're supposed to do then it becomes very hard. You need to pass a pointer to a function, but what should the function do? When you know that, just create such a function (as a global non-member function) and pass a pointer to it.  2 Answers 2  Lets say you want to print the value of each node in the tree:  You pass a pointer to the function in the call. That function will then be called for each node in the traversal.  The function you pass a pointer to can do other things, of course. And as it is currently declared, you can even modify the values of the tree.  i know but this explained what i wanted to know perfectly thankyou @someprogrammerdude  You need to spend weeks in reading more about C++. Remember, C++ is a very difficult programming language (even with 5 years of practice, you won't be an expert in C++; I do code in C++ but I am not expert in it; the C++ experts are perhaps only a few dozens only on Earth). And don't learn anything older than C++11 and preferably C++17 (since we are in 2019, so most recent C++ compiler are already C++17 compliant, and all of them accept C++11; if your compiler don't know about C++11, update your C++ compiler).  (if you are required to code in C++03 or some earlier C++, instead of C++11, ask for a pay raise, because then you are using obsolete tools. Today, in 2019, coding in C++03 is like coding in COBOL: it needs a rare skill that has monetary value.)  Then, compile with all warnings and debug info. If your compiler is GCC, compile with at least. You'll get a nice diagnostic message. Show it in your question please.  At last, you declared your as taking one argument, and you don't give any when calling that (and by so doing you are inconsistent):  You wrongly asked:  I am creating a binary search tree template class, and want to use function pointers  As I commented, you should avoid function pointers (they are so C like, not genuine C++), and use some type in the declaration of that , and pass perhaps some anonymous lambda expression at its call site. Because what you should pass conceptually is not a function pointer, but a closure (which combines a raw function pointer with data, the closed values), or, if you unfortunately want to avoid genuine C++ and stay compatible with plain C procedural programming style and calling conventions, have callbacks so pass not only a raw function pointer but also some client data.  So you really want to declare and define (like most C++ containers do)  (later, as an optimization, you might pass as a reference) and you would use it (with a lambda expression) like, for example:  I claim that your teacher should first teach you about closures ands how to nicely use them in some functional programming style (which is quite natural in your case), and then explain their implementation by also, and later, teaching function pointers. In most cases, function pointers are obsolete in C++ (but they exist for compatibility with C and obsolete versions of C++).  PS. What you don't understand takes several dozens of pages to explain (since the C++ type system is very complex). We don't have that much space here (and time to write it). Please take a week to read a good C++ book.  yeah i know i dont give it an arguement, i put it there to show what i mean. how do i use the inorder is what im asking  By clicking “Accept all cookies”, you agree Stack Exchange can store cookies on your device and disclose information in accordance with our Cookie Policy.
