The best possible way is to:  Run your code through Valgrind or Rational Purifyplus or any such memory analysis tools they shall help you determine what is exactly wrong and will point it out to you.  194k4747 gold badges414414 silver badges522522 bronze badges  5  the problem is that Purifyplus will very decrease performance of my application which turn in production in a high speed constraing environement  @Guillaume07: If your code is doing something funny these memory analysis tools will be able to detect it even if not the production environment.Also, this is only for detecting the bug and fixing it preferably on a debug version and not for release version.  But maybe in dev the code which cause the Application to crash will no be executed, because not cover by the different actions I will do in dev  @Guillaume07: If I were you and I was desperate to track down the bug I would take the chance of trying it out given that the probability of tools finding the bug is high.  By clicking “Accept all cookies”, you agree Stack Exchange can store cookies on your device and disclose information in accordance with our Cookie Policy.
