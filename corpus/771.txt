So I thought, the type of is wrong, so I just let the compiler deduce that:  Which doesn't work either.  All I need is an iterator member that is set at construction time, so I don't have to explicitly set it in some stupid extra function and can iterate over the map externally through:  If you want a non-const iterator, you have to construct your object from a non-constant reference.  By clicking “Accept all cookies”, you agree Stack Exchange can store cookies on your device and disclose information in accordance with our Cookie Policy.
