I tried googling but most implementations are for C++ or Java.If someone can point me to some online tutorials that are in C it would be great.  Look under section 4 at ece.uwaterloo.ca/~ece250/Lectures/Slides The site has many other data structures and algorithm implementations and explanation about them and their run time/ asymptotic analysis  Here's a bit of tutorial code from a couple of decades ago. In fact, it's been lying around so long, I don't remember where it came from or who wrote it (could have been me, but I'm really not sure). Theoretically it's a bit non-portable, using , which isn't part of the standard library, though most compilers have/supply it.  448k7474 gold badges586586 silver badges10491049 bronze badges  2  1  @Jerry..I was looking more for some tutorial rather than the actual code. I wanted to get a good grip on the concepts and then try it out myself...Anyways thanks!!!  @The Stig: Ah, but this is purely a starting point -- it doesn't currently support looking up particular values (should be pretty easy), deletion (somewhat non-trivial), maintaining balance (decidedly non-trivial), etc.  Code-only answers are rarely very useful or well received, but in this case the (ancient) question isn't asking for code at all, but rather for a reference to external documentation (a tutorial), so the code is barely responsive to the question at all. By the way, the question does not meet SO's current standards. If it were posed today, it would be quickly closed.  By clicking “Accept all cookies”, you agree Stack Exchange can store cookies on your device and disclose information in accordance with our Cookie Policy.
