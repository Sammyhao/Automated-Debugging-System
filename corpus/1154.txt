Thanks  By the way, it is good practice to only paste the code necessary to deduce the error.  2 Answers 2  the statement is returning the int declared by , but your function definition is , which expects you to return a pointer to a node struct. Change to  Make the return type "int" instead of "node *". Or rather, make it size_t as it must be an unsigned integer value.  size_t is an unsigned integer type defined in "string.h" header. How big it is (4 bytes or 8 bytes) is implementation defined. You can replace it with "unsigned int".  By clicking “Accept all cookies”, you agree Stack Exchange can store cookies on your device and disclose information in accordance with our Cookie Policy.
