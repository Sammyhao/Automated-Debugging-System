 Structure Sorting (By Multiple Rules) in C++  Prerequisite : Structures in C Name and marks in different subjects (physics, chemistry and maths) are given for all students. The task is to compute total marks and ranks of all students. And finally display all students sorted by rank. Rank of student is computed using below rules.  If total marks are different, then students with higher marks gets better rank.  If total marks are same, then students with higher marks in Maths gets better rank.  If total marks are same and marks in Maths are also same, then students with better marks in Physics gets better rank.  If total marks are same and marks in both Maths and Physics are also same, then students with better marks in Chemistry gets better rank.  If all marks (total, Maths, Physics and Chemistry) are same, then any student can be assigned bedtter rank.  We use below structure to store details of students.  We use std::sort() for Structure Sorting. In Structure sorting, all the respective properties possessed by the structure object are sorted on the basis of one (or more) property of the object. In this example, marks of students in different subjects are provided by user. These marks in individual subjects are added to calculate the total marks of the student, which is then used to sort different students on the basis of their ranks (as explained above).  Writing code in comment?
