I first sort the list of elements and then I perform the search. The sorting part works perfectly but my search isn't working properly. I know that the algorithm is correct but I have no idea how to go about the syntax.Could someone help me out?? PS This is my first question on stack overflow, BTW. :)  3 Answers 3  Compiler will issue a warning. Just pass in this. And also you forgot to as you have allocated memory to it using .  In case the number to be searched does not exist, it got in an infinite loop. This should fix it.  You forgot to add in the recursive calls. As a consequence, the function falls off the end without a proper return value.  Also, the check needs to be performed at the very top. Otherwise, you will see infinite recursion when is not in .  199k1313 gold badges140140 silver badges255255 bronze badges  5  To me it seems is never reached as all possible case for had been covered before, thus the missing final also would never be readched, thus its sole purpose would be to silence the compiler.  No, we have three return statements, one for , one for and one for . One of those matches in any case.  By clicking “Accept all cookies”, you agree Stack Exchange can store cookies on your device and disclose information in accordance with our Cookie Policy.
