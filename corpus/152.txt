I have a graph where I need to add and remove vertices, so I declared my adjacency list with listS as vertex list. I have a big problem with the call of depth_first_search() function: because of listS, I need to provide a Indexes Property Map, but I don't understand how I need to procedes. Here's the code:  When I'm going to compile this, this is the output:  I think this is a kind of template error. Can someone explain me where is the mistake?  You have a type in forward_or_cross maybe that fixes it. Template errors are hell to understand.  340k4545 gold badges424424 silver badges582582 bronze badges  2  Thank you very match!
