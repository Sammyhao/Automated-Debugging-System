I'm facing a problem with c++ vector and its iterator. I have tried to represent a adjacency list of a directed graph but failed. Here is my code: `  How did it fail? If you've encountered a compiler error, include it in your question. If you've encountered a runtime error, include it in your question. If you didn't get the results you've expected, add both the expected and actual results in your question. If your cat is on fire, call the fire brigade.  1 Answer 1  You should have told us about the compilation error that you've encountered.  Trying to compile your code immediately shows an inconsistency in the loop:  and on the following uses of . In fact you use in indexes, as if it were an . But you've declared it as an iterator:  Inexed access and iterators are two different concepts.  Solution 1: use indexes  Just use an index of type (or better ):  Solution 2: use iterators, but correctly  Let the compiler define the right type for the iterator, and then dereference the iterator (i.e. handle it as if it were a pointer):  You will immediately realize that you could as well use the range for to handle the inner loop:  Final remarks  You should always verify the user's data input, especially to ensure that it's in the valid range if you are using it as index.  By clicking “Accept all cookies”, you agree Stack Exchange can store cookies on your device and disclose information in accordance with our Cookie Policy.
