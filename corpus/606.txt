However, I can't use , nor to do this which means that I can't call an iterator for this purpose.  I am stumped as to how to go about it without an iterator.  Edit:  Just to clarify, my job is to implement all of the Map methods without using these three. I am stumped as to how to implement such methods as without an iterator.  , and are the only way to access the contents without knowing the keys in advance. Either this is a trick question (answer: you can't) or there's some other information that you haven't provided. Also, you should add the homework tag.  @so1201431 derisive? It's poor SO etiquette of you to post a question like this without the homework tag.  Now maybe you should explain why you can't use an iterator like this.  Or give us the implementation code so we can see how you store KV entries maybe we could help more with that. Only by using Map interface's methods there is no other way than with the 3 methods you are restricted to use  I have no idea why you are not able to use it. The implementation is done in the code above.  By clicking “Accept all cookies”, you agree Stack Exchange can store cookies on your device and disclose information in accordance with our Cookie Policy.
