 Given a linked list which is sorted, how will you insert in sorted way  Given a sorted linked list and a value to insert, write a function to insert the value in a sorted way. Initial Linked List  C++  C  Java  Python  C#  Javascript  Output:  Complexity Analysis:  Time Complexity: O(n). Only one traversal of the list is needed.  Auxiliary Space: O(1). No extra space is needed.  Shorter Implementation using double pointers: Thanks to Murat M Ozturk for providing this solution. Please see Murat M Ozturkâ€™s comment below for complete function. The code uses double-pointer to keep track of the next pointer of the previous node (after which new node is being inserted). Note that below line in code changes current to have address of next pointer in a node.  Writing code in comment?
