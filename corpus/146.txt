However, when I tried to print the tree from root, debugging shows that root it still null even through I initialized my tree  insert the array element in the tree knowing there will be no delete or add  1 Answer 1  When you pass the currentNode argument to the initializer you're passing a reference (pointer) of the object, in this case null. When in the method you reassign the variable:  Now currentNode references a new Node instance, but your currentNode variable on the Main class isn't updated, so it will remain null.  I recommend you to use a constructor for the BinaryTree class instead of an "initializer" method. Also the length parameter is not necessary (string.length does the same thing).  Finally you could unify the Node and the BinaryTree in one class.  By clicking “Accept all cookies”, you agree Stack Exchange can store cookies on your device and disclose information in accordance with our Cookie Policy.
