Why won't my other nodes get added to the tree?  Here is my BST Class:  And here is my Main(), eventually I would like to print the values of my BST in the console but first I know they need to be added to the tree:  2 Answers 2  Your should be of and not As a result you are not storing the values in the subtrees of the root. Replace this: with  in your code replace as follows:  Otherwise you don't have a tree and the nodes are not linked to each other  UPDATE: You get the NPE because you pass in the left child of root in the first comparison which is . You should not return but .

I was casting because I kept receiving Type mismatch errors. I went in just now and changed everything to BinarySearchTreeNode<T> and it seems to be working fine...well actually now I'm gettin a null pointer when I try to enter s1 @ this.data = data;  After the first insertion, you create new nodes, but don't do anything with them.  By clicking “Accept all cookies”, you agree Stack Exchange can store cookies on your device and disclose information in accordance with our Cookie Policy.
