Make a palindrome by adding the first half reversed. (Consider the two cases: even/odd length of the original number)  If this palindrome is greater than the original number you are done.  If it is not: Take the first half of the number and add 1.  Make a palindrome by adding the first half reversed. (Again consider the two cases: even/odd length of the original number).  32.4k44 gold badges5454 silver badges8080 bronze badges  4  If the number is a string, wouldn't it be much faster to simply iterate the string from both ends and compare first against last, until the iterators meet?  but how do i increment the number if it were a string?  – user5267182  Sep 3 '15 at 12:41  @al27 One way is to first convert it to an integer type, add 1 and then convert it back to a string.  @Lundin Indeed, that would be faster, but it wouldn't find the next number that is a palindrome.  By clicking “Accept all cookies”, you agree Stack Exchange can store cookies on your device and disclose information in accordance with our Cookie Policy.
