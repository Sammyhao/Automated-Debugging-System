When I try to run the sort function more than once I get the following error:  "Runtime-error '1004' The sort reference is not valid. Make sure that it's within the data you want to sort, and the first Sort By box isn't the same or blank."  As far as I can tell from the code and the data in the sheet, both the criteria from the error are met.  These are two of the sorts I need to perform, and if I run the macro with just one, either will work, but if I use both, the second sort will fail.  1 Answer 1  The above code tells the sort function only to sort one cell, A1. You need to specify the range e.g. .Range("A1:A100").  By clicking “Accept all cookies”, you agree Stack Exchange can store cookies on your device and disclose information in accordance with our Cookie Policy.
