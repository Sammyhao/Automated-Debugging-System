That way you will be able to use the various std algorithms (like summing, sorting, and many more).  @StephanM.G. I'm interested in figuring out this problem recursively with the road block of the sum being reinitialized with each call though unfortunately. And thank you for that link it's more manageable for my skill sets, but still looking into a recursive solution.  199k1313 gold badges140140 silver badges255255 bronze badges  3  Thank you for the advice regarding the while loop and recursive call, and thanks again for the feedback and helpful response.  By clicking “Accept all cookies”, you agree Stack Exchange can store cookies on your device and disclose information in accordance with our Cookie Policy.
